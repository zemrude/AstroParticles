    "text": "Why Python?\nAlthough certainly is not a requirement to understand the physics processes involved in astroparticle phenomena, it is beneficial to resolve numerically some of the proposed problems in order to better assimilate the concepts discussed during this course. The python programming language is used as a tool for constructing these numerical solutions. The advantage is that there exist complete mathematical libraries (numpy/scipy) for python, astronomical and analysis toolboxes (astropy/healpy), as well as powerful graphical visualization frameworks (matplotlib), which make it possible to easily construct problem solvers in a matter of minutes along with its graphical output. The idea is also to familiarize with what has become one of the most popular analysis tools in the high-energy physics as well as in the astronomy communities. A long this week we will use the following python modules related with astroparticle physics:\n\nastropy\nhealpy\ngammapy\ncrdb\n\nReferences will be added\n\nDisclaimer and Acknowledgments\nThese notes are far from original work. I limited myself to read the literature on the subject, assimilate and also re-elaborate concepts into what I hope is a coherent story, useful to give a feeling of how wonderful our Universe and Nature are. There is an endless list of people that inspired these notes and many references. Particularly, I acknowledge: T. K. Gaisser, F. Halzen, K. Hanson, A. Kappes, C. de los Heros, S. Gabici, T.

We will show that units are preserved along calculations:\n\nimport numpy as np\nvol_sphere = lambda r: 4*np.pi/3*r**3\nrho_Sun = M_Sun / vol_sphere(R_Sun)\nrho_Earth = M_Earth / vol_sphere(R_Earth)\n\n#A unit can be changed calling the .to(u.unit) method\ndisplay(Markdown (rf\"$\\rho_{{\\oplus}}$ = {rho_Earth.to(u.g/u.cm**3):.2f}\"))\ndisplay(Markdown (rf\"$\\rho_{{\\odot}}$ = {rho_Sun:.2f}\"))\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\oplus}\\) = 5.51 g / cm3\n\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\odot}\\) = 1412.12 kg / m3\n\n\nWe can use this module to make different transformations of uings, for example from light years to meters:\n\nly = 1 * u.lyr\n\ndisplay(Markdown (f\"Number of seconds for light to travel from Sun to Earth: {1./const.c.to(u.AU/u.s):.2e}\"))\ndisplay(Markdown (f\"Meters in a light year: {ly.to(u.m):.2e}\"))\n\nNumber of seconds for light to travel from Sun to Earth: 4.99e+02 s / AU\n\n\nMeters in a light year: 9.46e+15 m\n\n\nAssuming that the Galaxy is roughly a disk 50 kpc in diameter and 500 pc thick we can now calculate its density:\n\nV_Gal =  np.pi * (25000*u.pc)**2 * 500*u.pc\n\ndisplay(Markdown (f\"Volume of the Milky Way is approximately: {V_Gal.to(u.m**3):.2e}\"))\nM_Gal = 1E12 * M_Sun\nrho_Gal = M_Gal / V_Gal\ndisplay(Markdown (f\"Average density of Milky Way is {rho_Gal.to(u.g/u.cm**3):.2e}\"))\n\nVolume of the Milky Way is approximately: 2.88e+61 m3\n\n\nAverage density of Milky Way is 6.90e-23 g / cm3",

It can be considered as the effective area for a collision between a target and a projectile. The cross-section of an interaction depends on interaction force, the energy of the particle, etc…\nCross-section is typically measured in surface, \\(\\mathrm{cm}^2\\) or “barns”:\n\\[ 1 \\mathrm{ barn} = 10^{-24} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\]\nThe unit barn comes from the expression “big as a barn” as in the past physisits saw with surprise that interactions were more frequent than expected, and they thought the nucleus was in fact bigger than they thought… big as a barn.\nIf a flux of projectile particles are crossing a volume of target particles with cross section \\(\\sigma_N\\) then the disapperance of flux will be proportional to the initial number, the length travelled and number of target particles:\n\\[ \\mathrm{d} I = -I n \\sigma_N \\mathrm{d} x ,\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number density, ie, the number of particles per volume unit:\n\\[ n = \\frac{N}{V} \\]\nnote that the number density is related with the mass density as:\n\\[n = \\frac{N_A}{M} \\rho_m = \\frac{\\rho_m}{m_N}\\]\nwhere \\(N_A\\) is the avogadro number, \\(M\\) is the total mass of a mol and \\(m_N\\) is the mass of is the mass of a single particles N making up the volume.

    "section": "Time Scales and Time Standards",
    "text": "Time Scales and Time Standards\nThere are several time standards or ways to specify time. A time standard can affect the rate (ie, how long is a day) or reference or point in time, or both. Some standards are:\n\nMean solar time There are two solar times, the aparent one (also called true one) which depends on latitude and the year and the Mean solar time which the time of mean sun, the difference between the two is called the equation of time. The length of the mean solar day is slowly increasing due to the tidal acceleration of the Moon by the Earth and the corresponding slowing of Earth’s rotation by the Moon.\nUniversal Time (UT0, UT1) Is a time scale based on the mean solar day, defined to be as uniform as possible despite variations in Earth’s rotation\nInternational Atomic Time Is the primary international time standard from which other time standards, including UTC, are calculated. TAI is kept by the BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), and is based on the combined input of many atomic clocks around the world.\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time. UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC. The difference with UT1 is known as DUT1.\n\n\nTime Representations: JD and MJD\nThese are not technically standards (or scales), they are just reprentations (formats) of the aforementioned standards typically used in Astronomy:\n\nJulian Date Is the count of days elapsed since Greenwich mean noon on 1 January 4713 B.C., Julian proleptic calendar. Note that this day count conforms with the astronomical convention starting the day at noon, in contrast with the civil practice where the day starts with midnight (in popular use the belief is widespread that the day ends with midnight, but this is not the proper scientific use).\nModified Julian Date Is defined as MJD = JD - 2400000.5. The half day is subtracted so that the day starts at midnight in conformance with civil time reckoning. There is a good reason for this modification and it has to do with how much precision one can represent in a double (IEEE 754) variable. Julian dates can be expressed in UT, TAI, TDT, etc. and so for precise applications the timescale should be specified, e.g. MJD 49135.3824 TAI.\n\n\n\nTime in Experiments\nPractically speaking, in experiments time comes from one or more of the following sources:\n\nAtomic clocks (Cs, Rb) -They use the microwave signal that electrons in atoms emit when they change energy levels. These have very good short term performance but a Rb clock left by itself will wander by several ns per day. Cs clocks are perhaps better by a factor of 100x.\nGPS - The GPS gives precision timing too. The system consists of the space segment of O(30) satellites each equipped with Caesium atomic clocks and each constantly getting corrections from the central control facility. GPS broadcasts navigation and time messages synchronized to this ultraprecise time from which the user segment can extract time and space coordinates accurate to O(10) ns and meters, respectively. GPS time is based on the 86400 second day. It indirectly accounts for leap years. There are no leap seconds in GPS time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial II: Using Time Standards in Astropy\n\n\n\nTime conversions and coordinate conversions are best left to well-tested libraries. SLALIB is a famous set of Fortran libraries that do several transformation. For python I will use Astropy. The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages. Is included by default in the Anaconda distribution.\n\nfrom astropy.time import Time\nimport datetime\ni = datetime.datetime.now()\nprint (f\"Today's date and time: {i.isoformat()}\")\ntimes = ['1999-01-01T00:00:00.123456789', i.isoformat()]\nt = Time(times, format='isot', scale='utc')\nprint(f\"Today's julian date (UTC) is {t[1].jd:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Today's modified julian date (UTC) is {t[1].mjd:.2f}\")\n\ndt = t[1] - t[0]\nprint(f\"The time difference in mjd is {dt.value:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The time difference in seconds is {dt.sec:.2f}\")\n\nToday's date and time: 2025-03-31T12:58:54.240534\nToday's julian date (UTC) is 2460766.04\nToday's modified julian date (UTC) is 60765.54\nThe time difference in mjd is 9586.54\nThe time difference in seconds is 828277139.12",

    "text": "Astronomical Coordinate System\nCoordinate systems are used to map objects position in the sky. They can divided into local coordiantes and celestial coordinate systems:\n\nLocal coordinates\nThese are those that depend on from where on Earth you observe, ie they have the observer’s local position as reference. For example the horizontal coordinate system is expressed in terms of altitude (or elevation or zenith) angle and azimuth. These coordinates are not useful to inequivocally identify the position of an object in the sky since celestials object local coordinates change with time.\n\n\nCelestial coordinate systems\nThose systems are independent of the observer’s local position. Two of the mostly used coordinates systems in astroparticle are:\n\nEquatorial coordinates: It’s defined by an origin at the center of the Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of the Earth’s equator onto the celestial sphere. Coordinates are give by right ascension and declination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquatorial coordinate system\n\n\n\nGalactic coordinates: The galactic longitude, \\(\\ell\\) is the angular distance Eastward (counterclockwise looking down on the Galaxy from the GNP) from the Galactic Center and the galactic latitude, \\(b\\), is the angular distance outside of the plane of the Galaxy, positive up, negative down. Note that having a large galactic latitude is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for an object being extragalactic. This is how to get the image of the Galactic plane on the celestial sphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial III: Coordinate Transformations\n\n\n\nLet’s do some “representation” of the galactic plane.

This can be achieved if \\(k= + 1\\) and \\(\\rho\\) is appropriately tuned. But \\(\\ddot a\\) will not vanish in this case.

However, we believe that \\(\\Lambda\\) is actually nonzero, so Einstein was right after all. Assuming that cosmological constant is due to the vacuum energy, most quantum field theories predict a \\(\\Lambda\\) that is 120 orders of magnitude larger than the observational values! this is so-called cosmological constant problem.\n\n\nEvolution of the Cosmological Constants\nIn general the energy density will have contributions of distinct components which will evolve differently with the Universe expansion:\n\nMassive particles with negligible velocities are known in cosmology as dust or simply matter. Their density scales as the number density times their rest mass. Their number density scales as the inverse of the volume while the rest mass is constant: \\(\\rho_M \\propto a^{-3}\\)\nRelativistic particles are known as radiation (although it is not only photons) and their energy density is the number density times the particle energy, the latter is proportional to \\(a^{-1}\\) (as they redshift with expansion) and so: \\(\\rho_r \\propto a^{-4}\\)\nVacuum energy does not change as universe expand so we can define a \\(\\rho_\\Lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\Lambda}{8\\pi G} \\propto a^0\\)\nIt is useful to pretend that \\(-ka^{-2}R_0^{-2}\\) represents an effective curvature energy density defining \\(\\rho_k \\equiv -(3k/8\\pi G R^2_0)a^{-2}\\).\n\nGiven this evolution it is possible to write:\n\\[ H^2(t) = H^2_0 [\\Omega^0_M(1+z)^3 + \\Omega^0_r(1+z)^4 + \\Omega^0_k(1+z)^2 +\\Omega^0_\\Lambda]\\]",

    "text": "Cosmography\nUsing the Huble equation we are going to derive some quantities related to the measurement of the Universe.\n\nAge of the Universe\nWe have shown the evolution of the Hubble expansion as a function of the redshift using the clousure parameters. We know that\n\\[H(z) = \\frac{\\dot a}{a} = -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z/\\mathrm{ d}t}{(1+z)}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ d}t = -\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z}{(1+z)H(z)}\\]\nAnd so the age of the universe can be calculated as (where \\(z=0\\) corresponds to today \\(t_0\\)):\n\\[\\int_{0}^{t_0} \\mathrm{ d} t = t_0 = \\frac{1}{H_0} \\int^\\infty_0 \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z}{E(z)}\\]\nwhere we defined the following function:\n\\[E(z)\\equiv \\sqrt{\\Omega_M(1+z)^4 + \\Omega_r(1+z)^5 + \\Omega_k(1+z)^3 +\\Omega_\\Lambda(1+z)}.\\]\nAssuming a flat Universe \\(\\Omega_k =0\\) and ignoring the radiation \\(\\Omega_r \\ll \\Omega_M\\) the integral gets simplified to:\n\\[H_0 t_0 = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{1 - \\Omega_M}}\\mathrm{ In}\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1 - \\Omega_M}}{1 - \\sqrt{1- \\Omega_M}}\\right)\\] where we used \\(1 = \\Omega_\\Lambda + \\Omega_M.\\)\nFor \\(\\Omega_M = 0.70\\) and \\(\\Omega_\\Lambda = (1 - \\Omega_M) = 0.30\\) one finds \\(H_0 t_0 = 0.964\\) so that \\(t_0 \\approx \\frac{0.96}{H_0} = 13.5\\) Gyr. Which is similar to the assumption we did with a constant \\(H_0\\).\n\n\nComoving distance (Line of Sight)\nThe comoving distance between two nearby objects in the Universe is the distance between them which remains constant with epoch if the two objects are moving with the Hubble flow. That an object follows the Hubble flow if there is no peculiar velocities, ie, the only reason the 2 objects separate is due to the expansion of the Universe and not because the have relative velocities among them. The comoving distance has the expansion factored out and therefore remains constant with epoch. You can think of it as the distance measured with a ruler that also expands with the Universe. Using the same argument as above with the age of the Universe we can multiplying by the speed of light we can derive:\n\\[D_c(z) = \\int_{t}^{t_0} c\\mathrm{ d} t = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int^z_0 \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z^\\prime}{E(z^\\prime)}.\\]\nThis is the comoving distance along the line of sight. Ie, is the comoving distance from a galaxy at redshift \\(z\\) from us. If we want to estimate, let’s say, the distance between 2 galaxies at the same redshift but separated in angle \\(\\Delta \\theta\\), then the distance is given by \\(D_M \\Delta \\theta\\) where \\(D_M\\) is the transverse comoving distance. For a flat Universe \\(D_M = D_c\\) but if the curvature is not zero, the relationship depends on the trigonometric functions \\(\\sinh\\) (for a closed Universe) and \\(\\sin\\) (for an open Universe) to account for the curvature of spacetime.\n\n\nLuminosity Distances\nThe luminosity distance defined in cosmology is defined as the distace in which an object with intrinsic luminosity \\(L\\) is observed with flux \\(f\\), ie:\n\\[ f = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d_L^2}.\\]\nThis in terms of bolometric values, however sometimes we only observe a given bandwidth in frequency, ie, we have to replace \\(f\\rightarrow f(\\nu_o)\\) and \\(L \\rightarrow L(\\nu_{e})\\) where \\(\\nu_o\\) and \\(\\nu_e\\) are the observed and emitted frequencies. Since the luminosity is defined as energy delivered over interval of time, we can approximate it as:\n\\[ L(\\nu_e) = \\frac{Nh\\nu_e}{\\Delta t_e},\\] \\[ L(\\nu_o) = \\frac{Nh\\nu_o}{\\Delta t_o},\\]\nbeing \\(N\\) the number of photos. However the photons emitted are redshifted and photons observed at \\(\\nu_o\\) were emitted at \\((1+z)\\nu_o\\). The time intervals are also related by the expansion of the Universe as:\n\\[\\frac{\\Delta t_e}{\\Delta t_o} = \\frac{1}{(1+z)}.\\]\nSo we have that the emitted luminosity and the observed luminosity are related as:\n\\[L(\\nu_o) = \\frac{L(\\nu_e)}{(1+z)^2}.\\]\nThe observed luminosity is smaller than the emitted luminosity. On the other hand the relation between the observed flux and observed luminosity is the same as in a non-expanding Universe. ie:\n\\[f(\\nu_o) = \\frac{L(\\nu_o)}{4\\pi D_c^2},\\]\nwhere \\(D_c\\) is the co-moving distance. Putting everything together we have that:\n\\[f(\\nu_o) = \\frac{1}{(1+z)^2}\\frac{L(\\nu_e)}{4\\pi D_c^2} = \\frac{L(\\nu_e)}{4\\pi D_L^2},\\] so we have the relation between the luminosity distance and the co-moving distance as:\n\\[D_L = D_c(1+z).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial IV: Age of the Universe\n\n\n\nIn the about the age of the Universe we calculated an analytical solution for a given condition. No we are goign to use python to numerically solve the look-back time for any given set of cosmological parameters. For that we are going to rewrite the loopback formula in terms of the scale factor \\(a\\) since we have the redshift scale relation:\n\\[(1+z) = \\frac{1}{a}\\]\nwe can prove that:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z}{1 +z} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}a}{a}\\]\nTherefore the equation above that relates \\(\\mathrm{d}t\\) with redshift we can rewrite it at:\n\\[ \\mathrm{ d}t = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{H(a)a} \\]\nwith\n\\[  H^2(a) = H^2_0 [\\Omega^0_M a^{-3} + \\Omega^0_r a^{-4} + \\Omega^0_k a^{-2} +\\Omega^0_\\Lambda] \\]\nWe need to numerically integrate the right hand side of the equation. However, for some parameters this integration is circular, reaching a \\(a_{max}\\) then the \\(H^2(a_{max}) = 0\\)\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nplt.rcParams['font.family'] = \"STIXGeneral\"\nimport numpy as np\n#Lets use the inline figure format as svg\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\n\n#We take the current value of H0 from the astropy package\n\nfrom astropy.cosmology import Planck13\nH0 = Planck13.H(0).value\n\n#We define the friedman equation ignoring the radiation component omega_r &lt;&lt;\ndef friedman(a, omega_M, omega_lambda):\n    omega_k = 1 - omega_M - omega_lambda\n    H2 = H0**2 * (omega_M * a**-3 + omega_k * a**-2 + omega_lambda)\n    return H2\n\nimport scipy.integrate as integrate\n\n#This is a simple integration, it does not take into account a possible Big Crunch\n\"\"\"\ndef calculate_times(omega_m, omega_lambda):\n    t0 = integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, 1)[0]\n    times = []\n    scales = np.arange(0.1, 2, 0.01)\n    for a in scales:\n        time = integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, a)[0]\n        times.append(H0*(time - t0))  \n\n    return np.array(times), np.array(scales)\n\"\"\"\n\n#This integration takes into account a Big Crunch\ndef calculate_times(omega_m, omega_lambda):\n    #Lets check if there is a maximal, ie, if H^2(a) = 0\n    astep = 0.001\n    amax = 3\n    scales = np.arange(0.1, amax, astep)\n\n    f = friedman(scales, omega_m, omega_lambda)\n    ia, = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(f)))\n\n    if len(ia) != 0:\n        amax = scales[ia[0]]\n    \n    tmax = integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, amax - astep)[0]\n    #time today a = 1\n    t0 = integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, 1)[0]\n\n    #Empty x,y for the plots\n    times = []\n    scale = []\n    for a in scales:\n        if a &lt; amax: #If a &lt; amax we do the typical integral 0 -&gt; a\n            time = integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, a)[0]\n            times.append(H0*(time - t0)) #We calibrate at -t0 to place all curves together\n            scale.append(a)\n        if a &gt;= amax and 2*amax - a &gt; 0: #If a &gt; amax we are out the domain we integrate backwards\n            time = 2*tmax - integrate.quad(lambda x: 1/x * 1/np.sqrt(friedman(x,omega_m, omega_lambda)), 0, 2*amax - a)[0]\n            times.append(H0*(time - t0))\n            scale.append(2*amax - a)\n    return np.array(times), np.array(scale)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(5,4))\n\nomega_M = 0.3\nomega_lambda = 0.7\nx, y = calculate_times(omega_M, omega_lambda)\nax.plot(x, y, label=fr\"$\\Omega_M =$ {omega_M:.2f}, $\\Omega_\\Lambda =$ {omega_lambda:.2f}\")\n\nomega_M = 1.0\nomega_lambda = 0\nx, y = calculate_times(omega_M, omega_lambda)\nax.plot(x, y, lw = 2, label=fr\"$\\Omega_M =$ {omega_M:.2f}, $\\Omega_\\Lambda =$ {omega_lambda:.2f}\")\n\nomega_M = 0.3\nomega_lambda = 0\nx, y = calculate_times(omega_M, omega_lambda)\nax.plot(x, y, lw = 2, label=fr\"$\\Omega_M =$ {omega_M:.2f}, $\\Omega_\\Lambda =$ {omega_lambda:.2f}\")\n\nomega_M = 4\nomega_lambda = 0\nx, y = calculate_times(omega_M, omega_lambda)\nax.plot(x, y, lw = 2, label=fr\"$\\Omega_M =$ {omega_M:.2f}, $\\Omega_\\Lambda =$ {omega_lambda:.2f}\")\n\n\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper left\")\nax.grid()\nax.set_xlim(-1,1.5)\nax.set_ylim(0.2,2)\nax.set_ylabel(\"$a(t)$\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"$H_0 (t - t_0)$\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Age of the Universe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nYañez, Juan Pablo, and Anatoli Fedynitch. 2023. “daemonflux: DAta-drivEn MuOn-calibrated Neutrino\nFlux,” February. https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00022.",

    "title": "5  What are Cosmic Rays?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An historic perspective\nTo explain cosmic rays, we need to go back about 100 years to the year 1912 when Victor Hess concluded a series of balloon flights equipped with an electroscope. He measured how ionization in the atmosphere increased as he moved away from the Earth’s surface. The origin of this ionization had to be some type of radiation, and since it increased with altitude, the origin couldn’t be terrestrial. In other words, there existed, and still exdists, radiation coming from outer space. For this milestone, Victor Hess is known as the discoverer of cosmic rays. However, it would be unfair to attribute the merit solely to Hess, as many physicists before him had already paved the way that would culminate in his famous balloon flights: Theodor Wulf, Karl Bergwitz, and Domenico Pacini, among others, laid the foundations for one of the branches of particle physics that would dominate the field for the next 40 years until the advent of the first particle accelerators in the early 1950s.\nFrom the begining, cosmic rays were mysterious: What was their origin? What were these ionizing rays? During the 1920s, Bruno Rossi and Robert Millikan engaged in a lively debate on the nature of cosmic rays. Millikan proposed that cosmic rays were “ultra”-gamma rays, photons of very high energy created in the fusion of hydrogen in space. Rossi’s measurements, showing an East-West asymmetry in the intensity of cosmic rays, suggested instead that cosmic rays must be charged particles, disproving Millikan’s theories. There is a famous anecdote in which Rossi, during the introductory talk at a conference in Rome, said: &gt; Clearly, Millikan is resentful because a young man like me has shattered his beloved theory, so much so that from that moment on, he refuses to acknowledge my existence” A hundred years later, we know that Rossi was indeed correct. The majority, 90%, of cosmic rays are protons and other heavy nuclei. The ratio of nuclei faithfully follows the atomic abundance found in our Solar System, indicating that the origin of these particles is stellar. There are some exceptions; for example, lithium, beryllium, and boron are nuclei that we can find among cosmic rays in a proportion greater than in our environment. These nuclei are actually produced by the fragmentation of heavier ones, such as carbon, during their journey through space. Thus, the abundance ratio between carbon and boron provides information about how long carbon has been traveling through space.\nThe spectrum, or the number of particles per unit area and time as a function of energy, has also been measured in great detail over the last 30 years thanks to the work of numerous experiments. The cosmic ray spectrum is remarkable in both its variation and energy range. The number of particles, or flux, covers 32 orders of magnitude, so we find that the least energetic particles reach Earth at a rate of one particle per square meter every second. On the other hand, the most energetic ones arrive at a rate of one particle per square kilometer per year. This is why physicists have had to develop various experimental techniques to measure the spectrum of cosmic rays in its entirety: from particle detectors sent into space on satellites or attached to the International Space Station, to experiments deployed on large surfaces of the Earth to detect the most energetic cosmic rays, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory covering an area of about 3000 km2 on the high plateau of the Pampa Amarilla in Malargüe, Argentina.\nBut what makes cosmic rays truly fascinating is the amount of energy these particles can reach, far superior to what can be achieved today with the most powerful accelerator built by humans with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. The LHC is an underground ring with a length of 27 km located on the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland, using powerful magnets to accelerate protons to 99.99% of the speed of light. Despite the impressiveness of this experiment, if we were to accelerate particles to the energies of cosmic rays with the same technology, we would need an accelerator the size of the orbit of Mercury. The speed of cosmic rays is so high that the effects of space-time relativity are considerable. For example, although the radius of our Galaxy is about 100,000 light-years, due to the temporal contraction of special relativity, the most energetic cosmic rays would experience they will experience the journey in just 10 seconds. When cosmic rays reach Earth, they encounter 10 kilometers of atmosphere which, along with the Earth’s magnetic field, fortunately acts as a shield and protects us from radiation. However, when cosmic rays collide with atoms in the atmosphere, they trigger a shower of new particles. This shower is known as secondary cosmic rays, and in it, we can find a diverse array of new particles. This is why, for many years, the physics of cosmic rays was the only way for particle physicists to discover and study new particles. Thus, following in Hess’s footsteps, during the 1940s, many physicists moved from the laboratory to hot air balloons equipped with bubble chambers (a primitive version of a particle detector) to study this myriad of new particles. Among the new particles discovered were, for example, the first particle of antimatter: the positron, a positively charged electron, as well as the muon, with properties similar to the electron but with greater mass.\nBut what is the origin of cosmic rays? Which sources in the Universe are capable of accelerating particles to such energies? That is the question that, despite 100 years since Victor Hess’s discovery, physicists have not been able to fully answer. The main reason is, however, easy to understand. Cosmic rays, being charged particles, are deflected by magnetic fields during their journey through the Universe. Both the Milky Way and intergalactic space are immersed in magnetic fields, so when cosmic rays reach Earth, their direction has little or nothing to do with the original direction, making it impossible to do astronomy. However, despite this disadvantage, we can deduce some things about their origin based on, for example, their energy. We know that low-energy cosmic rays must come from our own Galaxy because the magnetic fields of the Milky Way would confine them until they eventually interact with Earth. On the other end of the spectrum, extremely high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) must come from outside our own Galaxy since they are so energetic that the magnetic fields of their respective galaxies would not be able to retain them. The exact turning point in energy between these two origins is uncertain. So far, we have been unable to undoubtivously observe a cosmic-ray source. One of the main candidates for the source of galactic cosmic rays are supernova remnants. At the end of a star’s life cycle, it can explode, releasing a large amount of mass and energy. What remains behind can be a neutron star surrounded by all the remnants left from the original star; this is what is called a supernova remnant. It is more challenging to conceive a cosmic accelerator capable of accelerating particles up to the energy equivalent of a soccer ball kicked at 50 km/h, which corresponds to the energies of UHECRs. Here the list of candidates is considerably reduced because there are fewer objects in the Universe with the magnetic field and size sufficient to act as a large particle accelerator. The candidates are active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. Active galactic nuclei are the nuclei of galaxies with a supermassive black hole at their center. These nuclei show beams of particles in opposite directions that could function as large accelerators. On the other hand, gamma-ray bursts are the most violent events known in the Universe, and their origin and nature would warrant another chapter of this book. Lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, these events can illuminate the entire sky by releasing their energy mainly in the form of very high-energy photons. But if cosmic rays never point to their source, how can we ever be sure that active galactic nuclei or gamma-ray bursts are the true sources of cosmic rays? To answer this puzzle, we need what has been dubbed as multi-messenger astronomy. Thanks to particle physics, we know that under the conditions in which, for example, a proton is accelerated to high energies, reactions with the surrounding matter can occur. These interactions would produce other particles such as very high-energy photons and neutrinos. Neutrinos are especially interesting because they are not only neutral and therefore travel in a straight line without being deflected by magnetic fields, but they are also weakly interacting particles, so unlike photons, they can traverse dense regions of the Universe without being absorbed. Future multi messenger experiments will be able to solve the mystery of cosmic rays.",

Propagation and deflection on magnetic fields depends on the rigidity.\nBy particles per energy-per-nucleon. Fragmentation of nuclei propagating through the interstellar gas depends on energy per nucleon, since that quantity is approximately conserved when a nucleus breaks up on interaction with the gas.\nBy nucleons per energy-per-nucleon. Production of secondary cosmic rays in the atmosphere depends on the intensity of nucleons per energy-per-nucleon, approximately independently of whether the incident nucleons are free protons or bound in nuclei.\nBy particles per energy-per-nucleus. Air shower experiments that use the atmosphere as a calorimeter generally measure a quantity that is related to total energy per particle.\n\nFor \\(E &gt; 100\\) TeV the difference between the kinetic energy and the total energy is negligible and fluxes are obten presented as particle per energy-per-nucleus.\nFor \\(E &lt; 100\\) TeV the difference is important and it is common to present nucleons per kinetic energy-per-nucleon. This is the usual way of presenting the spectrum for nuclei with different masses: the conversion in energy per nucleus is not trivial.\n\n\nPrimary Cosmic Rays\nThe energy spectrum of primary nucleons from GeV to ~ 100 TeV is given by:\n\\[I(E) \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^4 \\left(\\frac{E}{1\\; \\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{-2.7} \\frac{\\mathrm{nucleons}}{\\mathrm{m}^2\\; \\mathrm{s\\;sr\\;GeV}}\\]\nWhere \\(\\alpha \\equiv 1+ \\gamma = 2.7\\) is the differential spectral index and \\(\\gamma\\) the integral spectral index.

Also Mn, V, and Sc come from the fragmentation of Fe. These are usually referred as secondary cosmic rays.\nThe see-saw effect is due to the fact that nuclei with odd Z and/or A have weaker bounds and are less frequent products of thermonuclear reactions.\n\nBy measuring the primary-to-secondary ratio we can infer the propagation and diffusion processes of CR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosmic ray composition.

As can be seen there are several features worth noting:\n\nFor \\(E \\leq\\) 20 GeV the spectra is dominated by solar modulations and somehow follows the same spectral index as the proton spectrum, although with factor 0.01 in the normalization, which means that electrons contribute only 1% to the overall CR spectrum.\nAt about 5 GeV there is a change in the spectrum. Sometimes identified as the energy when electrons start too loose energy, and therefore the spectrum becomes steeper.\nFor \\(E &gt;\\) 50 GeV spectra is well fitted with a power law of \\(\\sim 3.1\\) for \\(e^−\\) and \\(\\sim 2.7\\) for \\(e^+\\). Since \\(e^−\\) domimate over \\(e^+\\) the overall spectrum (\\(e^− + e^+\\)) also follows a spectral index of \\(\\sim 3\\). Electron spectrum is much steeper than the proton one.\nThe sum spectrum (\\(e^− + e^+\\)) has a sharp break at \\(E \\simeq\\) 1 TeV, however this is dominated by the \\(e^−\\) with an estimate of a ratio of 3 − 4 in \\(e^−/e^+\\). This cutoff has been confirmed by DAMPE making it the first direct observation of this cutoff.\nThere is an excess measured by ATIC at \\(\\sim 700\\) GeV. The existance of that feature has, however, never been confirmed by other experiments (Fermi, DAMPE, HESS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGiven the diffusion loss length of electrons is about \\(300\\;\\mathrm{pc}\\) and confinement time in the Galaxy about \\(100\\;\\mathrm={yrs}\\) it is assumed that the electron spectrum above few TeV is dominated by nearby and young cosmic ray sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nAssuming the electron flux is only 1% of the protons. Is it the Earth positive charged-up?\n\n\n\n\nAntimatter\n\nAs antimatter is rare in the Universe today, all antimatter we observe are by-product of particle interactions such as Cosmic Rays interacting with the interstellar gas.\nThe PAMELA and AMS-02 satellite experiments measured the positron to electron ratio to increase above 10 GeV instead of the expected decrease at higher energy.\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(6,5))\n\ntab = crdb.query(\"e+/e-+e+\", energy_type=\"EK\")\n\nxlim = 0.8, 1e3\ntab = tab[(xlim[0] &lt; tab.e) & (tab.e &lt; xlim[1])]\n\nexperiments = (\"AMS01\", \"AMS02\", \"PAMELA\")\nfor i, (exp, mask) in enumerate(crdb.experiment_masks(tab).items()):\n    t = tab[mask]\n    sta = np.transpose(t.err_sta)\n    if exp in experiments:\n        ax.errorbar(t.e, t.value, sta, fmt=\".\", label=exp)    \n        \nax.set_xlim(*xlim)\nax.set_ylim(0, 0.3)\nax.grid(color=\"0.4\")\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_k$ [GeV]\")\nax.set_ylabel(r\"$\\frac{e^+}{e^-+e^+}$\")\nax.legend(\n    ncol=1,\n    loc=\"upper left\",\n)\nax.semilogx()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Positron excess\n\n\n\n\n\nThis excess might hint to to contributions from individual nearby sources (supernova remnants or pulsars) emerging above a background suppressed at high energy by synchrotron losses.",

    "text": "Propagation of Cosmic Rays\nOne trivial argument to discriminate between a Galacic or extra-Galactic origin of the origin of cosmic rays is to check whether or not the larmor radius, \\(r_L\\), of cosmic ray particles is of the order of the size of the Galaxy. As we showed, we can express the larmor radius as:\n\\[r_L \\simeq  1 \\;\\mathrm{kpc} \\left(\\frac{E}{10^{18}\\;\\mathrm{eV}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{Z}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{G}}{B}\\right)\\]\nand so the maximum energy to contain cosmic rays in the Galaxy is:\n\\[E &lt; 10^{18}\\;\\mathrm{eV} \\left(\\frac{h}{1\\;\\mathrm{kpc}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{G}}{B}\\right)\\]\nThere are many uncertainties in these numbers but we can assume that the size of the Galactic halo is \\(h \\sim 1 - 10\\; \\mathrm{kpc}\\), and the magnetic field in the halo is about \\(B \\sim 0.1 - 10 \\;\\mu\\mathrm{G}\\). Putting this number gives maximum energy of \\(E_{max} \\sim 10^{17} - 10^{20} \\;\\mathrm{eV}\\). Given this result we can assume that lower energy cosmic rays come from own Galaxy, otherwise they would have escaped.\n\nCosmic-ray Interactions\nSince the bluck of cosmic-ray particles are expected come from the Galaxy we can now evaluate where and how they will interact during their travel. There are two chiefly process in which a cosmic-ray particle can interact:\n\nCoulomb collissions: They occur when a particle interacts with another particle via electric fields.\n\nThe Coulomb cross-section for a 1 GeV particle is \\(10^{-30} \\; \\mathrm{cm}^2\\).\nFor 1 GeV cosmic-ray propating in the ISM (\\(n \\sim 1 \\; \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\)) the mean Coulomb interacion length rate is \\(1/n\\sigma \\sim 324100 \\; \\mathrm{Mpc}\\) which is much larger than the Galaxy size. Therefore coulomb collisions can be neglected.\n\nSpallations processes: It occurs when C, N, O, Fe nuclei impact on intestellar hydrogen. The large nuclei is broken up into smaller nuclei. A clear indication of a spallation comes precisely from the composition comparison with stellar matter.\n\n\nsigma = 1e-30 #in cm2\nn = 1 # in cm-3\nl = 1./(n*sigma) * 3.241e-25 # in Mpc\nprint (f\"The interaction length for Coulomb collisions is {l:.2} Mpc\")\n\nThe interaction length for Coulomb collisions is 3.2e+05 Mpc\n\n\n\n\nThe Interstellar Medium (ISM)\nGiven the low density of the Galactic halo it is clear that the spallation processes must occur in the Galactic Disk. The Galactic Disk is mostly populated by the Interstellar Medium or ISM. It is mostly composed by Hydrogen in 3 different phases:\n\nMolecular Gas. This phase is the more clumpsy as they gathered in molecular clouds that can reach densities of \\(10^{6} \\; \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\) which is still very low for our atmosphere standards (14 lower). It is composed of hydrogene in molecular form, \\(\\mathrm{H}_2\\), \\(\\mathrm{CO}\\). Sometimes called stars nurseries they are stars forming regions.\nAtomic Gas. Made up of neutral atomic Hydrogen (HI in astronomical nomenclature). The maps tracing the \\(\\mathrm{HI}\\) that is organized in a spiral pattern, like \\(\\mathrm{H}_2\\), and also its structure is quite complex, with overdensities and holes.\nIonized Gas. Is ionized Hydrogen or \\(\\mathrm{HII}\\).\n\nThe overall density of the ISM is \\(\\sim 0.1-1 \\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\). The interstellar gas is not a an static gas, but rather is subject to a turbulent motion.\n\n\nThe Leaky Box Model\nThe Leaky Box model is a very simple model used to describe cosmic-ray confinement. In this simplified phenomenological picture CRs are assumed be accelerated in the galactic plane and to propagate freely within a cylindrical box of size \\(H\\) and radius \\(R\\) (see Figure 6.1) and reflected at the boundaries; the loss of particles is parametrized assuming the existence of a non-zero probability of escape for each encounter with the boundary (Poisson process).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Representation of the leaky box model of the Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary-to-Secondary Ratios\nSince we know the partial cross-section of spallation processes we can use the secondary-to-primary abundance ratios to infer the gas column density traversed by the average cosmic ray.\nLet us perform a simply estimate of the Boron-to-Carbon ratio. Boron is chiefly produced by Carbon and Oxygen with approximately conserved kinetic energy per nucleon (see Superposition principle), so we can relate the Boron source production rate, \\(Q_B(E)\\) to the differential density of Carbon by this equation:\n\\[Q_B(E) \\simeq n_{ISM} \\beta c \\sigma_{f,B} N_C\\]\nwhere, \\(n_{ISM}\\) denotes the average interstellar gas number density and \\(N_C\\) is the Carbon density and \\(\\beta c\\) is the Carbon velocity and \\(\\sigma_{f,B}\\) is the spallation or fragementation cross-section of Carbon into Boron.\nThe Boron disappears by escaping the galaxy in Poisson process or lossing its energy. The disappearence of Boron can be written using a lifetime \\(\\tau\\) as:\n\\[D_B = \\frac{N_B}{\\tau}\\]\nassuming the amount of Boron in the Galaxy is constant per unit time, \\(\\dot{N}_B = 0\\), then the production of Boron has to be equal to the disappearence rate, in other words: \\[\\dot{N}_B = 0 = Q_B - D_B\\]\nWe can write:\n\\[\\frac{N_B}{N_C} \\simeq n_{H} \\beta c \\sigma_{\\rightarrow B}\\tau\\]\n\n\nBoron-to-Carbon Ratio\nThe plot below represents the latest measurements from PAMELA and AMS satellites of the Boron-to-Carbon ratio. The decrease in energy of the Boron-to-Carbon ratio suggests that high energy CR spend less time than the low energy ones in the Galaxy before escaping.\n\n\nCode\ntab = crdb.query(\"B/C\", energy_type=\"EKN\")\n\n# select only entries with systematic uncertainties\nmask = tab.err_sys[:, 1] &gt; 0\ntab = tab[mask]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(6,5))\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n# Let's plot AMS02 only\nfor i, (exp, mask) in enumerate(crdb.experiment_masks(tab).items()):\n    t = tab[mask]\n    sta = np.transpose(t.err_sta)\n    ax.errorbar(t.e, t.value, sta, fmt=\".\", label=exp)\n\n\nax.legend(ncol=2, frameon=False)\nax.grid()\nax.set_xlabel(\"$E_\\\\mathrm{kin} / A$ / GeV\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"B/C\")\nax.loglog()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: B/C ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Fit the B/C spectrum of AMS-02 data\n\n\n\nWe are going to retrive the data and fit it.

The lifetime \\(\\tau\\) for Boron includes the catastrophic loss time due to the partial fragmentation of Boron, \\(\\tau_{f,B}\\) and the escape probability from the Galactic confinement volume, \\(T_{esc}\\). The fragmentation cross section is \\(\\sigma_{f,B} \\approx 250\\) mbarn so we find that:\n\\[n_H \\tau_{f,B} = \\frac{n_H}{n_H \\beta c \\sigma_{f,B}} \\simeq 1.33 \\times 10^{14}\\; \\mathrm{s}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\]\nwhich is a good match with the loss time bound at \\(\\sim\\) 1 GeV but is larger at higher energies and does not depend on energy. For example at 1 TeV it is an order of magnitude larger:\n\\[ n_H\\tau(1\\; \\mathrm{TeV}) \\simeq 10^{14} 1000^{-0.3} \\sim 1.3 \\times 10^{13} \\mathrm{\\;s\\;cm}^{-3}\\]\n\nBorom Escape\nIt could be that Borom escape the leaky box, but that time will be \\(\\tau_{esc} = \\frac{H}{c}\\) which will be roughly:\n\\[\\tau_{esc} = \\frac{300\\;\\mathrm{pc}}{c} \\simeq 3\\times 10^{10}\\; \\mathrm{s}\\]\nwhich is too small compared to the effective lifetime found. This seems to indicate that CR do not travel in straight lines. Let’s assume that the overall process is a convination of both the borom fragmentation and another process with a lifetime \\(T\\). By summing the inverse of these processes (being exponential processes):\n\\[\\tau^{-1} =  n_H \\beta c \\sigma_{f,B} + T^{-1}\\]\nand solving for \\(T\\) we have that:\n\\[n_H T = \\frac{n_H}{\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\frac{1}{\\tau_{f,B}}} \\simeq \\frac{10^{14} \\; \\mathrm{s}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{\\left(\\frac{E}{\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{-0.3} -0.7} \\simeq 10^{14}\\left(\\frac{E}{\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{-0.55} \\mathrm{s}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\]\nThere no other physical loss process for Boron, so \\(T\\) really must be the escape of the galactic confinement (leaky box). But if the box has a size \\(H\\), \\(T_{esc}\\) will be H/c which is the time required by CR generated in the Galactic plane to escape the box of height \\(H\\)! However we know that \\(T \\gg H/c\\). So there must be something else confining the CR in the galaxy… what could it be?\n\n\nDynamics of Charge Particles in Magnetic Fields.\nBefore solving the problem what process in the Galaxy is confining the cosmic-rays, let’s review a bit the dynamics of charge particles in magnetic fields.\nLet’s assume the simplest case of a test particle or mass \\(m_0\\) and charge \\(Ze\\) and lorentz factor \\(\\gamma\\) in an uniform static magnetic field, \\({\\mathbf B}\\).\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma m_0 {\\mathbf v}) = Ze ( {\\mathbf v} \\times {\\mathbf B})\\]\nknowing the expression of \\(\\gamma\\) we derive this:\n\\[\nm_0\\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma \\mathbf{v}) = m_0\\gamma\\frac{d {\\mathbf v}}{dt} + m_0\\gamma^3 {\\mathbf v}\\frac{ \\mathbf{v} \\cdot {\\mathbf a}}{c^2}\\]\nIn a magnetic field the acceleration is always perpendicular to \\({\\mathbf v}\\) so \\({\\mathbf v\\cdot a} = 0\\) resulting in:\n\\[m_0\\gamma\\frac{d{\\mathbf v}}{dt} =  Ze ( {\\mathbf v} \\times {\\mathbf B})\\]\nThis equation tell us that there is no change in the \\(v_{\\parallel}\\) the parallel component of the velocity and the aceleration is only perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, \\(v_{\\perp}\\). Beacuse \\({\\mathbf B}\\) is constant this results in a spiral motion around the magnetic field. Now we are going to test what happens if the magnetic field is not uniform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial II: Motion of a charge particle in a slowly changing magnetic field\n\n\n\n\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nq = 1.0\nm = 10.0\ndt = 1e-3\nt0 = 0\nt1 = 10\nt2 = 20\n\n\nt = np.linspace(t0, t2, int((t2 - t0)/dt))\nn = len(t)\n\nr = np.zeros((n,3))\nv = np.zeros((n,3))\n\n#Initial conditions\n\nr[0] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nv[0] = [2.0, 0.0, 3.0]\n\n#B = array([0.0, 0.0, 5.0])\n\nB = np.zeros((n,3))\nB[0] = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 4.0])\ndB = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 5e-3])\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    a   = q/m* np.cross(v[i],B[i]) \n    v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dt\n    r[i+1] = r[i] + v[i+1]*dt\n    B[i+1] = B[i] + dB\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\n\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\nax.plot(r[:,0], r[:,1], r[:,2])\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"$x$\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"$y$\")\nax.set_zlabel(\"$z$\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScattering in Plasma\nThe picture above holds while the gyroradius is larger or smaller than the variation of the magnetic field. In the first case when \\(R_g \\ll (\\Delta B)\\) the charge particle will follow the substructure of the magnetic field. In the second case \\(R_g \\gg (\\Delta B)\\) the magnetic field irregularities are transparent to the particle. However when \\(R_g \\approx (\\Delta B)\\) then the particle sees the magnetic irregularities. In this case the particle will scattered almost inelastically in this irregularities. The picture of a test-particle moving in a magnetic field is a simplistic one. In reallity cosmic ray particles propagate in collisionless, high-conductive, magnetized plasma consisting mainly of protons and electrons and very often the energy density of cosmic ray particles is comparable to that of the background medium. As a consequence of that, the electromagnetic field in the system is severely influenced by the cosmic ray particles and the description is more complex than the motion of a test charged particle in a fixed electromagnetic field. This will generate irregularities in the magnetic field. The irregularities in the Galactic magnetic field are responsible for the diffusive propagation of cosmic rays.\n\n\nDiffusion of Cosmic Rays\nThe results above leads to think that CR experience diffusion in the galaxy. The equation that we used to relate the Boron production rate by the Carbon spallation process can be seen as a diffuse equation.\nIn diffusion the continuity equation states that the variation of the density \\(N\\) in time is given by its transfer of flux in area plus the source contribution:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t}= - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + Q\\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is intensity of any local source of this quantity and \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) is the flux.\nFick’s first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient in an isotropic medium:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{J}&=-D \\nabla N \\\\\nJ_i&=-D \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x_i}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere the proporcionality constant, \\(D\\), is called diffusion coefficient. Which leads to the diffusion equation of:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} =  D\\Delta N + Q \\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta\\) (or \\(\\nabla^2\\)) is the Laplace operator.\nIn the Leaky Box model the diffusion equation, ignoring other effects, can be written as:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial t} = D\\Delta N_i =-\\frac{N_i}{T_{esp}}\\]\nWe made use of the fact that the escape probability is constant per unit time (Poisson process) and so the distribution in time can be writen as:\n\\[N_i(t) = n_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{T_{esc}}}\\]\nIn the absent of collisions and other energy changing processes, the distribution of cosmic ray path lengths can also be written as:\n\\[N_i(z) = n_0 e^{-\\frac{z}{H}}\\]\nwith \\(z\\) the travel distance in the z-axis and \\(H\\) the heigth of the box. Using both expressions of the cosmic ray distribution (in time and in space), together with the diffusion formula above give us equation:\n\\[T_{esp} = \\frac{H^2}{D} \\]\nHowever we found from the B/C ratio that \\(T_{esc} \\propto E^{-\\delta}\\) with \\(\\delta = 0.55\\), therefore the diffusion coefficient is:\n\\[ D(E) \\propto E^{\\delta} \\sim E^{0.55}\\]\nNote that physically \\(D = D(z)\\) ie, diffussion will depend on distance to the disc, however in the leaky-box model we assumed that \\(D\\) is independent of that, which it is only an approximation.\n\n\nThe State-of-Art of Diffusion\nThe leaky box model is a very simplistic approximation but more realistic diffusion models, such as the numerical integration of the transport equation in the GALPROP code (Strong and Moskalenko 1998), lead to results for the major stable cosmic-ray nuclei, which are equivalent to the Leaky-Box predictions at high energy. However sofisticated models of transport should include effects such as:\n\nDiffusion coefficient non spatially constant.\nAnisotropic diffusion (Parallel vs Perpendicular)\nEffect of self-generation waves induced by CR.\nDamping of waves and its effects in CR propagation\nCascading of modes in wavenumber space\n\nEach of these effects might change the predicted spectra and CR anisotropies in significant ways.\n\n\nTransport Equation on Primary Cosmic Rays\nThe general simplified transport/dissusion equation that relate the abundances of CR elements can be given by:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial N_i(E)}{\\partial t} =\\frac{N_i(E)}{T_{esc}(E)} = Q_i(E) - \\left(\\beta c n_H \\sigma_i + \\frac{1}{\\gamma\\tau_i}\\right)N_i(E) + \\beta c n_H \\sum_{k\\ge i}\\sigma_{k\\rightarrow i}N_K(E)\\]\nwhere now \\(Q_i(E)\\) is the local production rate by a CR accelerator, the middle part reprensents the losses due to interactions with cross-section \\(\\sigma_i\\) and decays for unestable nuclei with lifetime \\(\\tau_i\\). The last term is the feed-down production due to spallation processes of heavier CR. We can simplified this equation depending if we are dealing with Primary or Secondary CR:\n\nPrimaries \\(\\rightarrow\\) neglect spallation feed-down.\nSecondaries \\(\\rightarrow\\) neglect production by sources: \\(Q_s = 0\\)\n\nFor example, let’s assume now a primary CR, \\(P\\), where feed-down spallation is not taking place (ie, they are not product of heavier CR) and no decay (most nuclei are stable, one exception is \\(^{10}\\)Be which is unstable and \\(\\beta\\)-decay), the equation can be written as:\n\\[\\frac{N_P(E)}{T_{esc}(E)} = Q_P(E) - \\frac{\\beta c \\rho_H N_P(E)}{\\lambda_P(E)} \\rightarrow N_P(E) = \\frac{Q_P(E)}{\\frac{1}{T_{esc}(E)}+\\frac{\\beta c \\rho_H}{\\lambda_P(E)}}\\]\nwhere we wrote \\(n_H = \\rho_H/m\\) and \\(\\lambda_P\\) is the mean free path in \\(\\mathrm{ g / cm}^2\\).\nWhile \\(T_{esc}\\) is the same for all nuclei with same rigidity, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is different and depends on the mass of the nucleus. The equation suggests that at low energies the spectra for different nuclei will be different (eg for Fe interaction dominates over escape) and will be parallel at high energy if accelerated on the same source. For proton with interaction lengths \\(\\lambda_{proton} \\gg \\lambda_{esc}\\) at all energies so the transport equation gets simplified to:\n\\[N_{p}(E) = Q_p(E)\\cdot T_{esc}(E)\\]\nie, we observe at Earth a proton density of \\(N_p(E)\\propto E^{-(\\gamma +1)} \\sim E^{-2.7}\\), and \\(T_{esc}(E)\\) goes with the inverse of the diffusion coefficient \\(D(E)\\), ie \\(T_{esc}(E) \\propto E^{-\\delta}\\), then at the production site the spectrum must follow \\(Q_p(E) \\propto E^{-\\alpha}\\) with:\n\\[\\alpha = (\\gamma + 1) -\\delta \\approx 2.1\\]",

    "text": "Acceleration of Galatic Cosmic Rays\nThree questions:\n\nWhat is the source of power?\nWhat is the actual mechanism?\nCan it reproduce the spectral index found? ### Energy density of galactic cosmic-rays\n\nIn cosmic ray physics we called spectrum to the flux per stero radian, so the relationship between them is:\n\\[\\Phi (E) = \\int_\\Omega \\mathrm{ d} \\Omega I(E) = 4\\pi I(E)\\]\nFor all-hemispheres. So we can relate the number density of CR with the spectrum by:\n\\[n(E) = \\frac{4\\pi}{v}I(E)\\]\nsince the flux is just the number density times the velocity.\nAnd so kinetic energy density of CR, \\(\\rho_{CR}\\) is therefore the integral of the energy density spectrum, \\(E\\cdot n(E)\\):\n\\[\\rho_{CR} = \\int E n(E) \\mathrm{ d} E =4\\pi \\int \\frac{E}{v}I(E) \\mathrm{ d} E\\]\nassuming for the Galactic CR (and that \\(v = c\\) for relativistic particles):\n\\[ I(E) \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^4 \\left(\\frac{E}{1\\; \\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{-2.7} \\frac{\\mathrm{nucleons}}{\\mathrm{m}^2\\; \\mathrm{s\\;sr\\;GeV}}\\]\nwe can calculate the energy density for cosmic-rays from above the solar modulations up the knee, which is given by:\n\\[ \\rho_{CR} = \\frac{4\\pi}{c} \\frac{1.8}{1 - 1.7} \\left[\\left(\\frac{E_{max}}{1\\;\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{1 -1.7} - \\left(\\frac{E_{min}}{1\\;\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{1 -1.7}\\right] \\approx 1\\; \\mathrm{ev\\;cm}^{-3}\\]\n\nimport scipy.constants as cte\nfrom astropy.constants import pc\n\ncspeed = cte.value(\"speed of light in vacuum\") * 1e2 # in cm/s\n\nemin = 1. #GeV\nemax = 1e5 # 100 TeV\nrho = 4 * np.pi /cspeed * 1.8 / (1 - 1.7) * (np.power(emax,1-1.7) - np.power(emin,1-1.7)) * 1e9 # in ev cm-3\n\nprint(r\"The energy density is $\\rho_{CR} \\approx %.2f$ $\\mathrm{ ev/cm}^{3}$\" %rho)\n\nThe energy density is $\\rho_{CR} \\approx 1.08$ $\\mathrm{ ev/cm}^{3}$\n\n\nThis energy density is comparable with the energy density of the CMB \\(\\rho_{CMB} \\approx 0.25\\) eV/cm\\(^{3}\\)\n\nRequired Power for Galactic Cosmic Rays\nIf we assume this value to be the constant value over the galaxy, the power required (called luminosity in astrophysics) to supply all the galactic CR and balance the escape processes is:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{CR} = \\frac{V_D \\rho_{CR}}{\\tau_{esc} }\\sim 4\\times 10^{40} \\mathrm{\\;erg\\;s}^{-1}\\]\nwhere \\(V_D\\) is the volume of the galactic disk\n\\[V_D = \\pi R^2 d \\sim \\pi (15 \\mathrm{\\;kpc})^2(300 \\mathrm{\\;pc}) \\sim 6 \\times 10^{66} \\mathrm{\\;cm}^3.\\]\n\nR = 15000 * pc.to(\"cm\").value # radius in Cm\nh = 300 * pc.to(\"cm\").value\nVd = np.pi * R **2 * h\nprint(r\"Galactic Volume is %.1e $\\mathrm{ cm}^{-3}$\" %Vd)\nevtoerg = cte.value(\"electron volt-joule relationship\") * 1e7 \ntesc = 1e14 # s cm^3 at 1 GeV\ntesc = tesc/0.1 # s\npower = (Vd * rho) * evtoerg / tesc\nprint(f\"Power L ~ {power:.2e} erg /s\")\n\nGalactic Volume is 6.2e+66 $\\mathrm{ cm}^{-3}$\nPower L ~ 1.08e+40 erg /s\n\n\nIt was emphasized long ago (Ginzburg & Syrovatskii 1964) that supernovae might account for this power. For example a type II supernova gives an average power output of:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{SN} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{42} \\mathrm{\\;erg\\;s}^{-1}\\]\nTherefore if SN transmit a few percent of the energy into CR it is enough to account for the total energy in the cosmic ray beam. That was called the SNR paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Required for &gt; 100 TeV\n\n\n\nThe derivation above was considered using the CR flux with an integral spectral index of \\(\\gamma = \\alpha -1 =  1.7\\) which describes well the CR up to the knee (See Section 6.1). This is the bulk of cosmic ray density. The power required for the high energy part will be significantly less due to the steeply falling primary cosmic ray spectrum. For example assuming an integral index of \\(\\gamma = 1.6\\) for \\(E &lt; 1000\\) TeV and \\(\\gamma = 2\\) for higher energy we get:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\sim 2 \\times 10^{39} {\\;\\mathrm{\\;erg/s\\; for\\;} } E &&gt; 100 \\mathrm{\\; TeV}\\\\\n\\sim 2 \\times 10^{38} {\\;\\mathrm{\\;erg/s\\; for\\;} } E &&gt; 1 \\mathrm{\\;PeV}\\\\\n\\sim 2 \\times 10^{37} {\\;\\mathrm{\\;erg/s\\; for\\;} } E &&gt; 10 \\mathrm{\\;PeV}\n\\end{aligned}\\] ` which are considerably less than the total power required for all the cosmic-rays. This power might be available from a few very energetic sources.\n\n\n\n\nFermi Acceleration\nFermi studied how it is posible to transfer macroscopic kinetic energy of moving magnetized plasma to individual particles. He considered an iterative process in which for each encounter a particle gains energy which is proportional to the energy.\nLet’s write the increase in energy as \\(\\Delta E = \\xi E\\) after \\(n\\) encounters then:\n\\[E_n = E_0(1 + \\xi)^n\\]\nwhere \\(E_0\\) is the injection energy in the acceleration region. If the probability of escaping this acceleration region is \\(P_{esc}\\) per encounter, after \\(n\\) the remaining probability is \\((1 - P_{esc})^n\\). To reach a given energy \\(E\\) we need:\n\\[n = \\log\\left(\\frac{E_n}{E_0}\\right)/\\log(1 + \\xi)\\]\nafter each interaction there is a fraction \\((1-P_{esc})\\) that remain and the rest escapes the accelerator. If \\(N_0\\) particles entered the “encounter” in the first place, after \\(n\\) interaction those remaining are:\n\\[N(\\ge  E_n) = N_0(1- P_{esc})^n\\]\nThese particles will always eventually escape since \\(P_{esc}\\) is not 0, but for any given number of cycles, \\(n\\), we can be sure that those remaining particles (whenever they escape) will have more energy than those that escaped at the cycle \\(n\\). We can rewrite:\n\\[\\log\\left(\\frac{N}{N_0}\\right) = n(1 - P_{esc}) \\]\nequalling \\(n\\) with the equation above we have:\n\\[\\frac{\\log (N/N_0)}{\\log (E_n/E_0)} = \\frac{\\log(1-P_{esc})}{\\log(1+ \\xi)}\\]\nFor any given energy then we have:\n\\[N(\\ge E) = N_0 \\left(\\frac{E}{E_0}\\right)^{-\\gamma}\\]\nwhere we defined\n\\[\\gamma = \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{1-P_{esc}}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\log (1+\\xi)} \\approx \\frac{P_{esc}}{\\xi} = \\frac{1}{\\xi}\\cdot\\frac{T_{cycle}}{T_{esc}}\\]\nwhere \\(T_{cycle}\\) is the characteristic time of acceleration cycle, and \\(T_{esc}\\) is the characteristic time to escape the acceleration region.\nNote that \\(N(\\ge E)\\) is the integral spectrum, the differntial spectrum is given by:\n\\[ n(E) \\propto E^{-1 - \\gamma} \\]\n\nFermi Mechanism\nA mechanism working for a time \\(t\\) will produce a maximum energy:\n\\[E\\leq E_0 (1+\\xi)^{t/T_{cycle}}\\]\nTwo characteristic features are apparent from this equation:\n\nHigh energy particles take longer to accelerate\nIf a given kind of Fermi accelerator has a limited lifetime this will be characterize by a maximum energy per particle that can produce. In the general mechanism we can imagine a particle encountering something moving at a speed \\(\\beta\\). This “something” can be for example a magnetic cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this general approach, the particle might enter at different angles and exit at difference angles. Let’s assume \\(O^\\prime\\) to be the reference system where the magnetic cloud is in the rest frame. A particle with energy \\(E_1\\) in the lab reference system will have total energy in this reference system given by the boost transformation with \\(\\beta\\) being the speed of the plasma flow (cloud:\n\\[E_1^\\prime = \\gamma E_1 (1 -\\beta \\cos\\theta_1)\\]\nBefore leaving the gas cloud the particle has an anegy \\(E_2^\\prime\\). If we transform this back to the lab reference system we get:\n\\[E_2 = \\gamma E_2^\\prime (1 +\\beta \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime)\\]\nAs the particle suffers from colissioness scatterings inside the cloud the energy in the moving frame just before it escapes is \\(E_2^\\prime = E_1^\\prime\\) and so we can calculate the increment in energy \\(\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\\) as:\n\\[\\xi = \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_1}  = \\frac{1 - \\beta \\cos \\theta_1 + \\beta\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime - \\beta^2\\cos\\theta_1\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime}{1 - \\beta^2} -1\\]\n\n\nFermi 2nd Order Acceleration.\nIn the second order (first chronologically) Fermi considered encounters with moving clouds of plasma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scattered angle is uniform so the average value is \\(\\langle \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime\\rangle = 0\\).\nThe probability of collision at angle \\(\\theta\\) with the cloud of speed V is proportional to the relative velocity between the cloud and the particle \\(c\\) if we assume it relativistic (factor \\(1/2\\) is there to have a proper normalization):\n\n\\[\\frac{dn}{d\\cos \\theta_1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{c - V\\cos\\theta_1}{c}=\\frac{1 -\\beta \\cos\\theta_1}{2}, {\\;\\; \\mathrm{ for\\;} -1 \\leq \\cos\\theta_1 \\leq 1}\\]\nand so:\n\\[\\langle \\cos\\theta_1\\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\cos\\theta_1 \\cdot \\frac{dn}{d\\cos\\theta_1} d\\cos\\theta_1}{\\int \\frac{dn}{d\\cos\\theta_1}d\\cos\\theta_1} = - \\frac{\\beta}{3}\\]\nParticles can gain or lose energy depending on the angles, but on average the gain is\n\\[\\xi = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\beta^2}{1 - \\beta^2} \\sim \\frac{4}{3}\\beta^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems wih the 2nd order acceleration\n\n\n\n\nThe energy increase is second order of \\(\\beta\\) and..\n… the random velocities of clouds are relatively small: \\(\\beta \\sim 10^{-4}\\) !!!\nSome collisions result in energy losses! Only with the average one finds a net increase.\nVery little chance of a particle gaining significant energy!\nThe theory does not predict the power law exponent\n\n\n\n\n\nFermi 1st Order Acceleration.\nLet’s imagine a shock moving through a plasma. In the reference system of the unshocked plasma the shock front approaches with speed \\(\\vec{u_1}\\) while the shocked plasma (left behind) moves at a slower velocity \\(\\vec{V}\\) where \\(|V| &lt; |u_1|\\). If we now changed to the reference system where the shock-front is at rest the gas unshocked now appears to approach speed \\(-\\vec{u_1}\\) while the shocked plasma recedes with speed \\({-\\vec u_2 = (\\vec{V} - \\vec u_1)}\\). A test cosmic ray particle crossing from any side of the shock, will always face an encounter with plasma aproaching at speed \\(|V|\\), hence \\(\\beta\\) now refers to this speed, the speed of the shocked (downstream) gas in the upstream reference system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Upstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Shockwave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Downstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Fermi first order acceleration. Different referenec systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe outcoming distribution of particles is not now 0, there is an asymmetry in the Fermi shock acceleration model, as particle in the upstream will re-enter the shock, only those going downstream can escape. Therefore the distribution follows the projection of an uniform flux on a plane:\n\n\\[\\frac{dn}{d\\cos \\theta_2^\\prime} = 2 \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime{\\;\\; \\mathrm{for\\;}  0 \\leq \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime \\leq 1}\\]\nwhich gives:\n\\[\\langle \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime\\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\cos\\theta_2^\\prime \\cdot \\frac{dn}{d\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime} d\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime}{\\int \\frac{dn}{d\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime}d\\cos\\theta_2^\\prime} = \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nThe incoming angle distribution is also the projection of an uniform flux on a plen but this time with \\(-1 \\leq \\cos\\theta_1 \\leq 0\\) and so \\(\\langle \\cos \\theta_1 \\rangle = -2/3\\)\n\nParticles entering the shockwave and exiting will have a gain of:\n\\[\\xi = \\frac{1 + \\frac{4}{3}\\beta + \\frac{4}{9}\\beta^2}{1 -\\beta^2} - 1 \\sim \\frac{4}{3}\\beta = \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{u_1 - u_2}{c}\\]\n\n\nEscape Probability\nThe escape probability of loss rate of particles is given by the ratio of the incoming flux and the outgoing flux of particles.\n\nIncoming rate. Let’s assume that the diffusion of particles is so effective that close to the shockwave the distribution of particles is isotropic. In this case the rate of encounters for a plane shock is the projection of an isotropic flux onto the plane shock. Let’s assume \\(n\\) to be the density of particles close to the shock, because it is isotropic it should follow:\n\n\\[\\mathrm{ d}n = \\frac{n}{4\\pi}\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega\\]\nassuming the particles moving at relativistic speed, the velocity across the shock is \\(c\\cos\\theta\\) therefore the rate of encounters of particles upstream with the shock is given by:\n\\[R_{in} = \\int \\mathrm{ d} n c \\cos\\theta = \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{ d} \\cos \\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{ d} \\phi\\frac{cn(E)}{4\\pi}\\cos\\theta = \\frac{cn(E)}{4}\\]\nwhere \\(n(E)\\) is the CR number density.\n\nOutgoing rate. The outgoing rate is simply the number of particles escaping the system. In the shock rest frame, that’s all particles not returning to the shockwave. In this reference system there is an outflow of cosmic-rays adverted downstream. Since particles are diffusing in all direction, the net outflow goes with the velocity of the downstream speed and is given simply by \\(R_{out} = n(E) u_2\\),\n\nTherefore the escape probability is given by:\n\\[P_{esc} = \\frac{R_{in} }{R_{out} }= \\frac{4 u_2}{c}\\]\nwhich for acceleration at shock gives:\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{P_{esc}}{\\xi} = \\frac{3}{u_1/u_2 -1}\\]\nSo we get an estimate of the spectral index based on the relative velocities of the downstream and upstram gas in the sockwave.\n\n\nKinematic Relations at the Shock\nIn order to derive the exact value of the spectral index we need to obtain a relation between \\(u_1\\) and \\(u_2\\) using the kinematics of a shock wave. This equations are the conservation of mass, the Euler equation for momentum conservation and conservation of energy:\n\nConservation of mass: \\[\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\vec{u}) = 0\\]\nConservation of momentum (Euler equation):\n\n\\[\\rho\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\vec{u} \\cdot(\\nabla\\vec{u}) = \\vec{F} - \\nabla P\\]\nwhere \\(\\vec{F}\\) is an external force, and \\(\\nabla P\\) is a force due to a pressure gradient.\n\nConservation of energy:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{\\rho u^2}{2} + \\rho U + \\rho\\Phi\\right) + \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\\rho \\vec{u}\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} + U + \\frac{P}{\\rho} + \\Phi\\right)\\right] = 0 \\]\nwhere this equation accounts for the kinetic, internal, and potential energy \\(\\Phi\\).\nLet’s assume a one-dimensional, steady shock in its rest frame (otherwise time derivates must be taking into account).\nThen the first equation becomes simply: \\[\\frac{d}{dx} (\\rho u) = 0\\]\nand the Euler equation simplifies to:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}(P + \\rho u^2) = 0\\]\nIn the energy equation we assume \\(\\Phi = 0\\):\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\rho u^3}{2} + (\\rho U + P)u\\right) = 0 \\]\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ \\rho u \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} + U + \\frac{P}{\\rho}\\right) \\right] = 0 \\]\nwhere \\(U\\) is the internal density per unit volume and we can write \\(\\rho U = \\frac{P}{\\Gamma -1}\\), where \\(\\Gamma = c_p/c_v\\) is the adiabatic index or heat capacity ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions of discontinuity at the shochwave\n\n\n\nLet’s assume we are in the shock ref system. Applyting these equations at the discontinuity of the shock we have the three conditions at the discontinuity of the shock:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_1 u_1 &= \\rho_2 u_2\\\\\nP_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 &= P_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2\\\\\n\\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{2} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma - 1} P_1 &=\\frac{\\rho_2 u_2^2}{2} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma - 1}  P_2\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nFor a gas with \\(P = K \\rho^\\Gamma\\) the speed of sound can be written as \\(c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P / \\rho}\\) or \\(\\rho c_s^2 = \\Gamma P\\). From the second condition we can write:\n\\[ P_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 =  \\rho_1 u_1^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{P_1}{\\rho_1 u_1^2}\\right)  = \\rho_1 u_1^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{c_s^2}{\\Gamma u_1^2}\\right) = \\rho_1 u_1^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{M_1}\\Gamma}\\right) \\]\nFor strong shocks \\(\\mathcal{M_1} \\gg 1\\) then the presure in the upstream is neglicable \\(P_1 \\sim 0\\)\nWe can isolate \\(\\rho_2\\) and \\(P_2\\) as:\n\\[\\rho_2 = \\frac{u_1}{u_2} \\rho_1\\]\n\\[P_2 = P_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 - \\rho_1 \\frac{u_1}{u_2}u_2^2 = P_1 + \\rho_1 u_1 (u_1 - u_2) \\sim \\rho_1 u_1 (u_1 - u_2)\\]\nUsing these expression ot eliminate \\(\\rho_2\\) and \\(P_2\\) from the third (enegy conservation) equation we have:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}u_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2}u_2^2 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma -1}\\frac{P_2}{\\rho_2} = \\frac{1}{2}u_2^2 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma -1} u_2 (u_1 - u_2)\\]\ngrouping by powers of \\(u_2\\):\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma -1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) u_2^2 - \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma -1} u_2u_1 + u_1^2 = 0 \\]\nmultiplying by \\(2/u_1^2\\): \\[\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma + 1 }{\\Gamma -1}\\right) t^2 - \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\Gamma -1} t + 1 = 0\\]\nwhere we defined \\(t \\equiv u_2/u_1\\) this quadratic equation has the 2 solutions:\n\\[ t = 1 \\rightarrow u_1 = u_2\\]\nie, no shock at all, and a second solution given by:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\Gamma - 1}{\\Gamma + 1} \\rightarrow \\frac{u_2}{u_1} = \\frac{\\Gamma - 1}{\\Gamma +1}\\]\nfor a monatomic gas with 3 degrees of freedom the ratio of specific heats is \\(\\Gamma = 1 + 1/f = \\frac{5}{3}\\), so\n\\[\\frac{u_2}{u_1} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\nNo matter how strong a shock wave is, a mono-atomic gas can only be compressed by a factor of 4. The spectral index is then:\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{P_{esc}}{\\xi} = \\frac{3}{u_1/u_2 -1} = 1\\]\nIf one keeps the factors of \\(1/\\mathcal{M}^2\\) (to prove if you are brave):\n\\[\\gamma \\sim 1 + \\frac{4}{\\mathcal{M}^2} \\sim 1.1\\]\nWhich matches remarkably to what we derived to be the differential spectral index at the accelerator:\n\\[ n(E) \\propto E^{-(\\gamma+1)} \\sim E^{-2.1} \\]\n\n\n\nMaximum Energy\nIn an infinite planar shockwave, all particles upstream will encounter again the shochwave. However particles can advent downstream. In diffuse shock accelerations, particules will diffuse travelling a distance \\(l_D\\) upstream, until they are reached by the shock moving at spead \\(u_1\\) in the upstream reference system. Particles will cross when:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nl_d &\\simeq \\sqrt{D t_d} \\\\\nl_d &= u_1 t_d \\\\\nt_d &\\approx \\frac{D}{u_1^2}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nAssuming a diffusion that depends on energy in the form of \\(D = D_0 E^{\\alpha}\\) we can get that the maximum energy corresponds to:\n\\[E_{max} \\leq \\left(\\frac{u_1^2 t_d}{D_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\]\nwhere we can assume \\(t_d\\) to be the time during which the mechanism is working, ie the livetime of the shockwave \\(t_d \\sim t_{age}\\). From the equation above we can conclude that the maximum energy:\n\nincreases with time\ndepends on: age, shock speed, magnetic field intensity and structure (through D)\nis not universal\n\\(D\\) and therefore \\(l_d\\) increases with energy, and the each cycle energy increases, so the last cycle is the longest\n\nWe can rewrite the diffusion coefficient as: \\[ D \\sim \\frac{l_d^2}{t_d} = l_d v \\] where \\(v\\) is the particle speed. A more detailed analysis gives \\(D = \\frac{1}{3}l_d v\\) where the factor 3 comes from the 3 dimensions. In other words, the diffussion coefficient can be understood as the product of the particle velocity \\(v \\simeq c\\) and its mean free path. At high energies, the mean free path between scatterings in the turbulent magnetic clous can be approximate as \\(l_d = r_L/r_0\\), where \\(r_0\\) is the size of the magnetic cloud and \\(r_L\\) the Larmor radius of the particle. Assuming that \\(r_L \\gg r_0\\) we can re-write:\n\\[ D = \\frac{r_L c}{3} \\sim \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{E c}{Z eB} \\]\nAnother way to see this, is to assume that mean diffusion path \\(l_d\\) cannot be smaller than the Larmor radius, since a magnetic field irregularities in a smaller scale than the Larmor radisu will be transparent. This is the regime of the Bohm diffusion and it is possible in higly turbulent magnetic fields, something that theoreticians think is possible when CR excite magnetic turbulence at shocks while being accelerated. This is called magnetic field amplification.\nIn that case, the diffusion coefficient depends linearly with energy (\\(\\alpha = 1\\)) and the equation above can be rewritten as:\n\\[E_{max} \\leq 3 \\frac{u_1}{c} Z e B (u_1 t_{age})\\]\nwhere \\(t_{age}\\) is the time in which the accelerator is working. Note that the product \\((u_1 t_{age})\\) is the radius of a expanding shell. Using some estimates on the time (\\(t_{age} \\sim\\) 1000 yrs as the typical SN shockwave) and \\(B_{ISM} \\sim 3 \\mu\\)G we can rewrite the maximum energy for SN shockwaves as:\n\\[E_{max} \\leq Z\\times 3 \\times 10^4 \\mathrm{ GeV}\\]\nIn order words, the shock-wave acceleration shown can accelerate CR up to 100 Z TeV, but not beyond this. Other acceleration mechanism are needed for the highest energy cosmic rays. We need very high magnetic fields (non-lineal acceleration mechanism). In these cases, even if this object cannot supply the all the galactic cosmic rays the energy per particle may be orders of magnitude higher than those possible in shock acceleration by blast waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillas Criteria\n\n\n\nThe equation of the maximum energy from shock acceleration can be rewritten as:\n\\[E_{max} \\leq 10^{18} \\mathrm{eV}\\; Z \\;\\beta_s \\left(\\frac{R}{\\mathrm{kpc}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{B}{\\mu\\mathrm{G}}\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_s\\) is the shock velocity, \\(B\\) the magnetic field strength, and \\(R = u_1 t_{age}\\) is the radius of the expanding shockwave, or in other words the size of the acceleration reguin. In 1984 Hillas arrived to a similar conclusion just by doing a back-of-an-envelope assumption that in order for it to accelerate CR particles to high energies in which he impossed that a condition where the size of the acceleration region must be at least twice the Larmor radius. The plot showing possible sources in the parameter space \\(B\\) vs \\(R\\) is usually referred as the Hillas’ plot. For relativistic shockwaves (\\(\\beta_s \\sim 1\\)) many sources are able to accelerate protons up to \\(10^{20}\\) eV, however for slower shockwaves (\\(\\beta_s \\sim 1/300\\)) the number of source candidates is strongly reduced.",

    "text": "Sources of Galactic Cosmic Rays\n\nSupernova Remnants (SNRs)\nSupernova remnants (SNR) remain the most likely candidates for CR acceleration up to at least \\(10^{14} \\mathrm{ \\; eV}\\) via the Fermi shock mechanism. Supernova explosions are very violent events which transfer a significant amount of energy in the ISM. We distinguish between the SN explosions –the actual events and the next few years) and Supernova remnants - what happens over the next few thousand years. Supernova explosion mechanism can be the carbon deflagration of white dwarts (Type I) or the core collapse of masssive stars (Type II) but the dynamical evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR) i.e., the expanding cloud of hot gas in the ISM is similar and can be divided in 3 phases depending on the relation between the ejected material, \\(M_{ej}\\) and the swetp material \\(M_{sw}\\):\n\nFree Expansion Phase. \\(M_{ej} \\gg M_{sw}\\) The shock wave moves in the ISM gas a highly supersonic speed. The speed is constant as there is no acceleration and so the shock radius scales as \\(R_s(t) = v_e t\\). Behind the shockfront ISM gas starts to accumulate an a reverse shock starts to form. Sometimes we see first this reverse shock. At some point the compressed ISM gas equals the ejected material, this marks the end of the free expansion phase. Given an initial density of ISM \\(\\rho_{ISM}\\) we can can define a swept material as: \\[M_{sw} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\pi R_{sw}^3\\rho_{ISM}\\] When the condition \\(M_{sw} \\simeq M_{ej}\\) is reached, this marks the end of the free expansion phase and the swept radius can be defined as: \\[R_{sw} = \\left(\\frac{3M_{ej}}{4\\pi\\rho_{ISM}}\\right)^{1/3}\\] This radius is reached at the defined swept time \\(t_{sw} =R_{sw}/v_{sh}\\) which is about 200-300 years.\nSedov-Taylor Phase. Once the reverse shock reaches the nucleus, the interior of the SNR gets very hot that energy losses due to radiation are not possible (all atoms are ionized). The cooling of the gas is only due to the expansion, that’s why this phase is the adiabatic phase. This is therefore a pressure-driven phase. Taking the pressure into account we can use the following formula: \\[\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}t}(m v) = F\\] \\[\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}R_{sh}^3\\rho_{ISM}\\dot{R}_{sh}\\right) = 4\\pi R^2_{sh}P\\] The pressure and internal energy \\(E\\) of an ideal gas are related by: \\[P = (\\gamma -1)\\frac{E}{V}\\] where \\(V\\) is the volume. Since this is an adiabatic expansion we can assume that the internal energy is equal to the explosion energy \\(E =E_{SN}\\), and \\(V = 4\\pi R_{sh}^3 /3\\). Assuming a mono-atomic gass with a adiabactic index \\(\\gamma = 5/3\\) we obtain as pressure: \\[P = \\frac{E_{SN}}{2\\pi R_{sh}^3},\\] which inserting on the expression above we have:\n\\[\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}R_{sh}^3\\rho_{ISM}\\dot{R}_{sh}\\right) = \\frac{E_{SN}}{2\\pi R_{sh}}.\\] Solving for \\(R_{sh}\\), assuming it has a form of \\(R_{sh} \\propto t^\\eta\\) we obtain: \\[R_{sh}(t) = \\left(\\frac{25E_{SN}}{4\\pi \\rho_{ISM}}\\right)^{1/5}t^{2/5}\\] \\[v_{sh}(t) = \\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\frac{25E_{SN}}{4\\pi \\rho_{ISM}}\\right)^{1/5}t^{-3/5}.\\]\nAs can be seen, the radius goes as \\(R_{sh} \\propto t^{2/5}\\). When temperature reaches the critical value of \\(10^{6}\\) K ionized atoms start to capture free electrons and can lose energy due to de-exitation. This is the end of the adiabatic phase. This phase can last 20,000 years.\nCooling or Snowplough phase Due to the effective radiative cooling the thermal presure decreases and the expansion slows down. More and more interstellar gas is accumulated until the swept-up mass is much larger than the ejected material. Finally the shell breaks up into clumps probably due to Rayleigh-Taylor inestabilities. This phase lasts up to 500,000 years.\n\nAs we discussed, the \\(E_{max}\\) depends on how long the accelerator is active. Therefore an individual CR particle will gain the highest energy if it starts during the free expansion phase and stays within the shock front until and through the Sedov phase. There is a caveat though, the \\(E_{max}\\) also depends on the magnetic field, and magnetic fields during the slow expansion of the Sedov phase are not strong enough to confine the CR particle. In this case, it seems the maximum CR energy may only be reached during the pre-Sedov expansion. This is the reason why young SNR are the main candidates to search for CR injection up to PeV energies.\n\n\nOther Sources of Galactic Cosmic Rays\n\nNeutron stars\nA neutron star is a stellar remmant that results from the collapse of a massive star after a supernova. As the core of a massive star is compressed during the supernova, the reaction \\(e^- + p \\rightarrow n + \\nu_e\\) can take place which transforms the core into a neutron rich matter. Neutron stars, especially young fast-rotating pulsars and magnetars have extreme magnetic fields (up to \\(10^{12}\\; \\mathrm{G}\\) in the case of magnetars) with complex structure that could accelerate CR up to the highest energies. These objects are far rarer than SNRs, however, only a dozen magnetars are known in the Milky Way, although many could exist in the local neighborhood.\n\n\nMicroquasars\nMicroquasars are radio-intense X-ray binary stars with a companion orbiting an accreting compact object. They are particularly interesting particle accelerators due to observation of VHE gamma ray emission and highly relativistic jets which could provide energy for UHECR",

He found a persistent noise in the radio from the centre of the Galaxy too loud to be due to thermal black body radiation.\n1953 Ginzburg & Shklovski suggested it was due to synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic electrons, confirmed with discovery of predicted polarization in M87 light.\nSandange labeled 3C48 a quasar or quasi-stellar object (it appeared pointlike).\nIn 1962 3C273 radio source position was found with precision of 1 arcsec, which allowed to find the optical counterpart at z = 0.158 (not 1 star but a galaxy).\nIn 1963 Hoyle and Fowler speculated that the tremendous emitted energy is due to the gravitational collapse of a very massive object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGN Classification\n\n\n\n\nThere is two broad classes: Radio quiet (90%) and Radio Loud (10%) depending on the pressence of jets or not.\nThe unified model of ANGs suggests that different AGNs are infact the same object seen from different angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts\n\nGRBs are short bursts lasting a few seconds of \\(\\gamma\\)-ray photons from 0.1 - 1 MeV.\nThey were discovered in the 60s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space as the US suspected the URSS might carry on secret nuclear tests despite the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\nThey have been hypothesed (given their occurence) to have caused mass extintions events (thousand times since life begun), in particular they are associated with the Ordovician–Silurian extinction.\nThere is some observational evidence suggesting that progenitor of a GRB are stars undergoing a catastrophic energy release by the end of their lifes \\(\\rightarrow\\) Hypernovas\n\nThe accepted phenomenological pictured of GRBs is of an expanding relativistic wind fireball dissipating kinetic energy. The observed afterglow on some GRBs result from the collision of the expanding fireball and the surroundings.\nIn the fireball, the observed radiation is produced by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons, similar to SNRs. Hence, it is likely that protons will be also shock accelerated. The two conditition for GRBs to be sources of UHECR are:\n\nThe proton acceleration time must be smaller that the wind expansion time, ie, you need to accelerate protons during the burst duration.\nThe proton synchrotron loss time must exceed the acceleration time, otherwise you loose energy before you accelerate them.\n\nThese two conditions lead to a constrain in the Lorentz boost factor for GRBs:\n\\[\\gamma \\geq 130\\left(\\frac{E}{10^{20}\\mathrm{\\; eV}}\\right)^{3/4}\\left(\\frac{0.01\\mathrm{\\; s}}{\\Delta t}\\right)^{1/4}\\]\nwhich matches what we see from GRBs. However IceCube has not seen any neutrino associated with GRBs which puts in tension the idea that GRBs can be the only sources of UHECR.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nGrupen, Claus. n.d.

    "text": "The Atmosphere\nBefore studying the interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere we need to setup a model that will describe our atmosphere. To study the cosmic rays interactions in the atmosphere it is useful to define a parameter that we will call the vertical atmospheric depth (sometimes also called column density) defined as the integral in altitude of the atmospheric density \\(\\rho\\) above the observation level \\(h\\):\n\\[X(h) =\\int_h^{\\infty} \\rho(h^\\prime)\\mathrm{ d}h^\\prime\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Isothermal Model of the Atmosphere\nIn an isothermal hydrostatic atmosphere a particular layer of gas at some altitude is static. That means that the downward (towards the planet) force of its weight, plus the downward force exerted by pressure in the layer above it, and the upward force exerted by pressure in the layer below, all sum to zero. Assuming a segment of area \\(A\\) and heigth \\(\\mathrm{ d}h\\) we can write this equilibrium of forces as:\n\\[P\\cdot A - (P + \\mathrm{ d}P)\\cdot A - (\\rho A \\mathrm{ d}h)g_0  =0\\]\n\\[\\mathrm{ d}P = -g_0\\rho(h) \\mathrm{ d}h\\]\nUsing the ideal gas law:\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\rho R T}{M}\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the ideal gas constant, \\(T\\) is temperature, \\(M\\) is average molecular weight, and \\(g_0\\) is the gravitational acceleration at the planet’s surface. We get\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}P}{P} = -\\frac{g_0 M}{R T} \\mathrm{ d} h\\]\nassuming a constant and isothermal gas (const \\(T\\)) we can integrate a pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height as:\n\\[P = P_0 e^{-\\frac{g_0 M}{R T} h} \\]\nwhere the we can define the scale height as:\n\\[ h_0 = \\frac{R T}{M g_0} \\]\nSince the temperature is assumed to be constant it follows that \\(\\rho\\) also changes exponentially as \\(\\rho = \\rho_0 e^{-h/h_0}\\) and therefore the column density can be written as:\n\\[X = X_0 \\mathrm{ e}^{-h/h_0}\\]\nwhere \\(X_0\\) is 1030 g/cm\\(^{2}\\) is the atmospheric depth at sea level, h = 0. In particular for the isothermal model we have that the relation between atmospheric depth (aka column density) and density is:\n\\[ \\rho(X) = \\frac{X}{h_0} \\]\n\nThe Scale Height\nUsing typical values (\\(T = 273\\) K and \\(M = 29\\) g/mol) we get that \\(h_0 \\sim 8\\) km which coincidentally is the approximate height of Mt. Everest.\nIn reality the temperature changes and hence the scale height decreases with increasing altitude until the tropopause.\nThis equations are valid for vertical particles, for zenith angles &lt; 60\\(^\\circ\\) (for which we can ignore the Earth’s curvature) the formula is scaled with \\(1/\\cos{\\theta}\\) giving the slant depth\n\\[X_{slant-depth} = \\frac{X}{\\cos \\theta} \\]\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Losses in the Atmosphere\nCharge particles when entering in the atmosphere will suffer different process of energy losses. We are going to review some of them\n\nIonization Losses\nThe ionization energy loss of high energy charged particles with colission with atomic electrons is given by the Bethe-Block formula:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} E}{\\mathrm{ d} x}\\right)_{ion}= -\\left(\\frac{4\\pi N_0z^2e^4}{mv^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)\\left\\{\\log\\left[\\frac{2mv^2\\gamma^2}{I}\\right]-\\beta^2\\right\\}\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron, \\(v\\) and \\(ze\\) are the velocity and charge of the incoming particle, \\(N_0\\) is the Avogadro’s number, \\(Z\\) and \\(A\\) are the atomic and mass numbers of the atmos in the medium and \\(x\\) the path travelled, and \\(I\\) is the ionization potential of the medium is approximatively 10 Z eV.\n\nSince \\(Z/A \\sim \\frac{1}{2}\\) in most materials it depends little on the medium.\nIt varies as \\(1/v^2\\) at low speed and independent of the incident particle mass.\nIt reaches a minimum at about \\(3Mc^2\\) and it increases logarithmically until it reaches a plateu value.\n\n\n\nRadiation Losses\nIn addition to ionization losses, charge particles also undergo bremsstrahlung or braking radiation when travelling through a material given by:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} E}{\\mathrm{ d} x}\\right)_{rad} = -\\frac{E}{X_0}\\] where for electrons the radiation length is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{X_0} = 4 \\alpha\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)(Z + 1)^2r_e^2N_0\\log\\left(\\frac{183}{Z^{1/3}}\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(r_e = e^2/4\\pi m_e c^2\\) is the classical electron radius and \\(\\alpha = \\frac{1}{137}\\) is the fine structure constant.\n\nBremsstrahlung is proportional to \\(\\frac{1}{X_0} \\propto r^2_{e} \\propto 1/m_e^2\\). The radiation length of a muon will be \\((m_\\mu/m_e)^2\\) times that for an electron.\nBremsstrahlung is proportional to the energy.\n\nThe critical energy is the energy at \\((\\mathrm{ d}E/\\mathrm{ d}x)_{ion} = (\\mathrm{ d}E/\\mathrm{ d}x)_{rad}\\). Above this energy the radiation process dominates, below the ionization. For electrons this is roughly \\(\\epsilon_c \\sim 600/Z\\) MeV, and for the atmosphere this is \\(\\epsilon_e \\sim 85\\) MeV.\n\n\nCherenkov Radiation\nWhen relativistic particles traverse a medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium it can induce Cherenkov radiation.\n\nCherenkov light is emitted in the UV and blue region in a narrow cone with angle:\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{ct/n}{\\beta c t} = \\frac{1}{\\beta n}\\]\nso the threshold for production is \\(\\beta &gt; \\frac{1}{n}\\). Most of the components in the air shower will produced abundant Cherenkov light.\nWe will see more on Cherenkov radiation on the next lesson about \\(\\gamma\\)-ray astronomy.\n\n\nPair Production\nIf a photon from bremsstrahlung has enougth energy \\(E_\\gamma &gt; 2 m_e\\) it can produced a pair of electron positron. The cross-section rises quickly at the threshod of \\(2 m_e\\) but in the high energy part it can be approximated to:\n\\[\\sigma = \\frac{7}{9} r_0^2 Z (Z+ 1)\\log \\left(\\frac{183}{3\\sqrt{Z}}\\right)\\]\nThe pair production cannot occure in vacum, a photon desintegrated to the pair \\(e^-e^+\\) will have a null momentum in the CoM system, therefore a nucleus has to be present to absorb the momemtum. As can be seen the radiation length \\(X_0\\) is very similar to the one from radiation losses. In fact we can write:\n\\[\\frac{1}{X_{pair}} = \\frac{7}{9}\\frac{1}{X_0}\\]\nWhich means that the radiation lengths for braking radiation and pair production are comparable.",

    "text": "Electromagnetic Shower\nWhen photons from radiation losses of electrons, have enough energy to produce pairs of positrons electrons, these hey also can produce photons which, in turn, can also produces pairs, etc, etc. This is called an electromagnetic shower.\n\nThe Heitler Toy-Model\nThe Heitler toy model explains very well the development of an electromagnetic shower. As we saw, in the ultrarelativistic limit the radiation lenghs for pair production and bremsstrahung are comparable. We can defined a distance \\(d_{split} = X_0 \\log2\\) where an electron will looses, on average, half of its energy.\nAn electron with inital energy \\(E_0\\) in a medium will generate a photon in a \\(d_{split}\\) length of energy \\(E_0/2\\), in the next radiation length the photon can convert into \\(e^+e^-\\) each with energies \\(E_0/4\\). After \\(t\\) steps the electrons, positrons will have energies of \\(E(t)=E_0/2^t\\). This continues until the electrons, positrons fall below the critical energy of electrons, \\(\\epsilon_e\\), and ionization dominates. The process is illustrated in the figure below, where each step \\(n\\) corresponds to one \\(d_{split}\\) length.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heitler model has the following properties:\n\nThe shower has maximum at:\n\n\\[t_{max} = \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)}{\\log2}\\]\n\nThe maximum number of particles is:\n\n\\[N_{max} = 2^{t_{max}} = \\frac{E_0}{\\epsilon_e}\\]\n\nThe shower maximum will be at a depth \\(X_{max}\\):\n\n\\[X_{max}=d_{split} \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)}{\\log2} = X_0 \\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)\\]\nFor air \\(\\epsilon_e = 85\\) MeV and the radiation length \\(X_0 = 36.7 \\mathrm{ g/cm}^2\\). Actual showers also spread laterally mostly due to Coulomb scattering. The lateral spread is a few times the so-called Moliere unit equal to \\(21/\\epsilon_e\\) (MeV).\nThe \\(X_{max}\\) prediction of the Heitler model is in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. However, the electron to photon ratio of 2 is not in agreement given that the model predicts only one photon emitted by bremsstrahlung. Simulations show a ratio of 1/6 since in reality several photons are emitted and electrons lose energy much faster than photons do.",

    "section": "Hadronic Showers",
    "text": "Hadronic Showers\nBefore modeling the baryon-induced showers or hadronic showers, we need to estimate the nuclean mean free path in the atmosphere. We can write the standard mean free path for \\(\\sigma^{air}_N\\) nucleon-air cross section as:\n\\[l_N = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_N^{air}}\\]\nwhere as we saw in the introduction \\(n\\) is the number density of targets, in our case air nuclei. This number density can be expresed as $n = N_T/V $ where \\(N_T\\)is the total number of air nuclei in volume \\(V\\).\nThe density mean free path, is defined as \\(\\lambda_N = \\rho_{air} l_N\\), where \\(\\rho_{air} = n \\cdot m_{air}\\) where \\(m_{air}\\) is the mass of air nuclei, that can be written as \\(m_{air} \\sim A m_p\\). Puttin everything together we have that:\n\\[\\lambda^{air}_N = \\rho_{air} l_N = n A m_p\\frac{1}{n\\sigma_N^{air}} = \\frac{A m_{p}}{\\sigma_N^{air}}\\]\nFor air \\(A\\) is average mean the mass number of air nuclei components (mainly nitrogen, oxygen) and we can assume it to be \\(A \\sim 14.5\\) and \\(\\sigma_N^{air} \\approx\\) 300 mb, which corresponds to \\(\\lambda_N^{air} \\approx 80\\)g/cm\\(^{2}\\).\nNote that this definition of the density mean free path is independent of the mass density of the medium, so if the density changes with altitude, like in the case of our atmosphere, the density mean free path is the same.\n\nThe Heitler-Matthew Model\nIn the Heitler model can be adapted also for hadronic showers. This is what Matthew did. We can imagine a proton initiating the cascade instead of a photon/electron, in this case a hadronic air shower will develope:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can assume that the first interaction is defined by the proton mean free path \\(\\lambda^{air}_N\\). Defining the first interaction point where the proton will lose (on average) half of its energy this first interaction length is given as \\(\\lambda^{air}_{N} \\log 2\\) where for protons \\(\\lambda^{air}_N \\approx 80\\)g/cm. The following general interaction is expected:\n\\[ p + p/n \\rightarrow p + n/p + \\pi^0 + \\pi^{\\pm} + K^0 + K^{\\pm} + .. \\]\nWe will focus only on pion production (same argument can be done for kaons). After the first interaction we can use the simplified assumption that the hadronic interaction produces only \\(3N_\\pi\\) pions. Of those $ 2 N_$ will be charged pions and \\(N_\\pi\\) will be \\(\\pi^0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also assume the energy is equally distributed among them, so \\(2/3E_0\\) will go to charge pions and \\(1/3E_0\\) will go to the neutral pions. The \\(\\pi^0\\) has a very short decay time, so it will decay and produce an electromagnetic shower. Charge pions will continue generating hadronic shower in each \\(d_{split} = \\lambda_{\\pi}^{air} \\log 2\\) with the mean free path of pions \\(\\lambda_\\pi^{air} \\sim 120\\)g/cm\\(^2\\) until they reach the critical energy where pions decay is more probable than interactions \\(\\epsilon_\\pi\\). On each step we assume that energy is equally divided among the \\(3 N_\\pi\\) pions. Thefore at each step \\(t\\) the energy of the pions is:\n\\[E_\\pi = \\frac{E_0}{(3N_\\pi)^t} \\]\nThe number of radiation lengths \\(t\\) to reach the critical energy ie \\(E_\\pi = \\epsilon_\\pi\\), and is given (as in the case of EM showers):\n\\[t_{max} = \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_\\pi)}{\\log(3N_\\pi)}\\]\nAssuming that after that energy all charged pions (ie \\(2N_\\pi\\)) decay to muons, the number of muons is given by:\n\\[N_\\mu =(2N_\\pi)^{t_{max}}\\]\nintroducing \\(\\beta = \\log(2N_\\pi)/\\log(3N_\\pi)\\) we have:\n\\[N_\\mu =(E_0/\\epsilon_\\pi)^\\beta \\]\nThis is also called the multiplicity and corresponds to the muon bundles as we will see later. For pions between 1 GeV and 10 TeV an appropiate number is \\(N_\\pi = 5\\) and in that case \\(\\beta = 0.85\\). Therefore the number of muons doesn’t grow linearly with the intial energy but a slower rate.\nThe definition of \\(X_{max}\\) is somehow less clear than in an EM shower. Hadronic showers are still dominated by electromagnetic processes, so we can assume that \\(X_{max}\\) depends dominantly on the first generation of \\(\\pi^0\\) EM subshowers. For proton primaries, the first interaction will be given by the nucleon mean free path where in this first interaction the proton splits in \\(3N_\\pi\\) particles, so \\(pi^0\\) with initial energy \\(E_0/3N_\\pi\\) will initiate an EM shower. The depth of maximum is then obtained as the sum of the first proton interaction length and the shower maximum of the first EM sub-shower:\n\\[X_{max} = \\lambda^{air}_N \\log2 + X_0 \\log\\left(\\frac{E_0}{3N_\\pi\\epsilon_e}\\right) \\]\nwhere again \\(\\epsilon_e\\) is the critical energy of electrons. The expected values of this formula are low when compared to detailed simulations because it neglects the contributions of the next one or two generation of \\(\\pi^0\\) production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperposition model for heavy nuclei air showers\n\n\n\nWe can extend the discussion to heavy nuclei by adopting the Superposition model in which a nucleus of mass A and energy \\(E_0\\) essentially generates \\(A\\) subshowers of energy \\(E_0/A\\). In that case the muon multiplicity will be:\n\\[N_\\mu = A \\left(\\frac{E_0}{A\\epsilon_\\pi}\\right)^\\beta \\propto E_0^\\beta A^{1 - \\beta} \\]\ntherefore the muon multiplicity will depend on the CR composition. Likewise the shower maximum is given by:\n\\[X^{A}_{max}(E_0) = X_{max}^{p}(E_0) - X_0\\log{A}\\]\nie, for a given energy \\(E_0\\) the shower max depends on the mass of the CR primary and it is typicall smaller than for protons (ie reach the maximum sooner in the atmosphere). For composition studies therefore it is necessary to measure \\(X_{max}\\) and the energy of the shower, which can be estimated from fluorescence techniques.",

As we saw energy losses via ionization is almost constant, for muons is about \\(\\sim 2\\) MeV/(g/cm\\(^{2}\\)) in air (and mostly independent on the material). However this is true only above energies of 1 GeV, below ionization losses increase drastically as can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_\\mu \\leq E_\\mu \\leq \\epsilon_{\\pi,K}\\), where \\(\\epsilon_\\pi = 115 \\;\\mathrm{GeV}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_K = 850 \\;\\mathrm{GeV}\\). In this range all mesons decay and muons spectrum follows the same of the parent spectrum of mesons and hence that of the primary CRs. The muon is almost independent of the zenith angle.\n\\(E_\\mu \\gg \\epsilon_{\\pi,K}\\), Mesons interaction length starts to be comparable to their decay length. This happens first for inclined showers and so the muon flux gets suppressed while it also starts to depend on the zenith angle (ie on the density of the atmosphere).\n\nAt even highers energies, above 1 TeV in air, muons will also start to loose energie via other radiative process (we will see that below when talking about muons underground).\n\n\nMuon Flux Analytical Approximation\nAn approximate extrapolation formula valid when muon decay is negligible (\\(E_\\mu &gt; 100/\\cos\\theta\\) GeV) and the curvature of the Earth can be neglected (\\(\\theta &lt; 70^{\\circ}\\)) is given by the Gaisser parametrization:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}E_\\mu \\mathrm{d}\\Omega} = \\frac{0.14}{\\mathrm{cm^2\\;s\\;sr\\;GeV}}\\left(\\frac{E_\\mu}{\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right)^{-2.7}\\left[F_\\pi(E_\\mu, \\theta) + F_K(E_\\mu,\\theta)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(F_\\pi\\) and \\(F_K\\) represent the contributions from pions and kaons, respectively:\n\\[F_\\pi(E_\\mu, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1.1 E_\\mu \\cos\\theta}{115 \\;\\mathrm{GeV}}}\\]\n\\[F_K(E_\\mu, \\theta) = \\frac{0.054}{1+\\frac{1.1 E_\\mu \\cos\\theta}{850\\;\\mathrm{GeV}}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Plot the muon flux for two different angles\n\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport numpy as np\nplt.rcParams['font.family'] = \"STIXGeneral\"\nplt.rcParams.update({'axes.labelsize': 20})\nplt.rcParams.update({'legend.fontsize': 20})\nplt.rcParams.update({'figure.figsize': [8, 6]})\nplt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 18\nplt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 18\nplt.rcParams['xtick.major.width'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['xtick.minor.width'] = 1\nplt.rcParams['xtick.major.pad'] = 8\nplt.rcParams['xtick.direction'] = 'in'\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.size'] = 10\nplt.rcParams['ytick.minor.size'] = 5\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.width'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['ytick.minor.width'] = 1\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.pad'] = 8\nplt.rcParams['ytick.direction'] = 'in'\nplt.rcParams['legend.frameon'] = False\nplt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['axes.linewidth'] = 1.5\n\ndef muons(cangle, E):\n    a = 1./(1.+ 1.1*E*cangle/115.)\n    b = 0.054/(1.+ 1.1*E*cangle/850.)\n    return 0.14 *E**-2.7 *(a + b)\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\nax.set_xscale(\"log\")\nax.set_yscale(\"log\")\nax.set_ylim(1e-5, 3e-1)\nax.set_ylabel(r\"$E_\\mu^{2.7} dN_\\mu/dE_\\mu [cm^{-2}s^{-1} (GeV)^{1.7}]$\")\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\mu(GeV)$\")\nax.grid()\nE = np.arange(1e0, 1e6, 10)\nax.plot(E, E**2.7*muons(np.cos(75*np.pi/180.),E), label=r\"$\\theta = 75^{\\circ}$\")\nax.plot(E, E**2.7*muons(np.cos(0*np.pi/180.),E), label=r\"$\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasured Muon Flux\nIn reality below 10 GeV muon decay and energy loss become important and the Gaisser parametrization overestimates the muon flux as can be seen in the plot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Particle Data Group\n\n\nAs can be seen from the measured muon flux has the following characteristics:\n\nMuons are the most numerous charged particles at sea level\nThe mean energy of muons at the ground is \\(\\sim\\) 4 GeV.\nThe integral intensity of vertical muons above 1 GeV/c at sea level is \\(\\approx 70 \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\) or \\(\\approx 1 \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\nMuon Bundles\nSometimes muons also come in groups or bundles of parallel muons originated from the same primary CR.

Why pions don’t decay in to electrons?\n\n\n\nNeutrino Fluxes and Kinematics\nAs mentioned neutrinos and muons are strongly correlated. However due the two-body kinematics, the energy spectra of the \\(\\nu\\)’s and \\(\\mu\\)’s from mesons decay are different. For example, the energy of the muon in CoM is given by:\n\\[E_\\mu^{*} = (m_\\pi^2 + m_\\mu^2)/2m_\\pi = 109.8\\;\\mathrm{MeV}\\]\nand for the neutrino:\n\\[E_\\nu^{*} = (m_\\pi^2 - m_\\mu^2)/2m_\\pi = 29.8\\;\\mathrm{MeV}\\]\nIn the laboratory system, the energies are boosted by the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma= E_\\pi /m_\\pi\\), but as can be seen muon carry a much larger fraction of energy than neutrinos. For energies about \\(1\\;\\mathrm{TeV}&lt; E_\\nu &lt;  10^3\\;\\mathrm{TeV}\\), the angle averaged atmospheric \\(\\nu_\\mu + {\\bar \\nu_\\mu}\\) can be approximated by a power law spectrum:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_{\\nu_\\mu + {\\bar \\nu_\\mu}}}{\\mathrm{d}E_\\nu} = 7.8 \\times 10^{-11}\\left(\\frac{E_\\nu}{1\\;\\mathrm{TeV}}\\right)^{-3.6}\\mathrm{cm^2\\;s^{-1}\\;sr^{-1}\\;GeV^{-1}}\\]\n\n\nFluxes as Function of Zenith\nAnother difference with respect to the muon fluxes is their dependency with respect to the zenith angle. Since atmospheric muons are not absorved by the Earth, their spectrum spans to the whole sky. The following plot shows the calculated neutrino flux at 1,300 m depth with energies \\(E_\\nu = 10\\) GeV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: arXiv:1210.5154\n\n\nThe peak at the horizon in the atmospheric neutrino flux is due to the so-called secant theta effect. This effect occurs because pions and kaons that are produced nearly skimming the Earth have more flight time in less dense atmosphere, so they have more chance to decay than interact.\n\n\nPrompt Fluxes\nApart from kaons and pions, charmed messons will also be produced in the atmosphere. Charm particles have lifetimes so short (\\(10^{-12}\\)s) they almost alway decay before interacting. Muons and neutrinos from charm decay are called prompt muons/neutrinos. They have the following peculiarities:\n\nThe energy spectrum follows the one of the primary cosmic rays ie that of \\(\\sim E^{-2.7}\\).\nSince there is no competition between decay and interaction of the charm particle, the prompt flux is fully isotropic.\nSince neutrinos are produced in 3-body decays they produced the same amount of \\(\\nu_\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu_e\\).\n\nIt is important to note that the prompt fluxes have not been observed yet.\n\n\n\n\nYañez, Juan Pablo, and Anatoli Fedynitch. 2023. “daemonflux: DAta-drivEn MuOn-calibrated Neutrino Flux,” February. https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00022.",

    "text": "Ionization. The continuous energy loss of muons passing through a medium as it ionize the material along the path. We saw however that ionization is mostly independent of the material, as most of them have values of \\(Z/A \\sim 0.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBremsstrahlung. Also called braking radiation. In the electric field of a nucleus or atomic electrons, muons can radiate high energy photons. If the photon has energy enough it can initiate an electromagnetic shower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPair production. A muon can radiate a virtual photon which, again in the electric field of a nucleus, can convert into a real \\(e^+e^-\\) pair. As in the case of bremsstrahlung, the pair production will initate an electromagnetic shower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotonuclear interactions. A muon can radiate a virtual photon which directly interacts with a nucleus in the muon propagation medium. The interaction is either electromagnetic or following the fluctuation of the photon into a quark-antiquark pair (i.e. a virtual vector meson). This interaction will generate an hadronic shower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuon Energy losses\nThe energy losses due to ionization are continuous while in radiation processes the energy is lost in bursts along the muon path. When a muon is travelling through a dielectric medium like ice or water, it will emit cherenkov photons as wells, but due to the stochastics energy losses electromagnetic and hadronic showers are generated along the muon track. The following figure illustrates this process:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that photonuclear interactions are subdominant when compared to bremsstrahlung and pair-production, so most of the showers will be electromagnetic showers. The equation that describes the energy loss for muons at high energy can be simplified to:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}E_\\mu}{\\mathrm{ d}X} = -\\alpha -\\beta E_\\mu\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the thickness of the material (in \\(\\mathrm{ g/cm}^2\\)), \\(\\alpha\\) is the energy loss due to ionization and \\(\\beta = \\beta_{br} + \\beta_{pair} + \\beta_{ph}\\) are the three discrete energy loss processes: bremsstrahlung, electron-positron production and electromagnetic interaction with the nuclei. Thickness is also given sometimes in units of meters water equivalent (1 m.w.e. = \\(10^2 \\mathrm{\\; g/cm^2}\\)). Due to the energy dependency of the radiative processes, higher energy muons will have more stochastic energy losses than lower energy muons.\nThe critical energy is when both losses are equal, ie \\(\\epsilon_\\mu = \\alpha/\\beta\\). Typical values are \\(\\alpha \\simeq 2 \\mathrm{ \\;MeV\\;g}^{-1} \\mathrm{ \\;cm}^2\\) and \\(\\beta \\simeq 4 \\times 10^{-6} \\;\\mathrm{ g^{-1}\\;cm^2}\\), so \\(\\epsilon_\\mu \\approx 500\\) GeV.\nThe following plots showd simulated muons bundles in IceCube. The stochastic energy losses are particular clear in the right figure.\n\n \n\n\n\nMuon Range\nBy solving the energy loss equation we can estimate the range \\(R\\) for a muon \\(E_\\mu\\), ie the underground depth this muon will reach until its energy is 0 (in reality the muon when reaching low energies will decay):\n\\[ R(E_\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\log\\left( 1 + \\frac{E_\\mu}{\\epsilon_\\mu}\\right)\\]\nAssuming the muon spectrum at sea level can be approximated to a power law \\(I_\\mu(&gt;E_\\mu) = AE_\\mu^{-\\gamma}\\) and using the relationship between range and energy we can write the depth-intensity relation (DIR):\n\\[I_\\mu(&gt;E_\\mu, R) = A\\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}(e^{\\beta R} - 1)\\right]^{-\\gamma}\\]\nThe plot below shows the depth-intensity muons for vertical directions.

    "text": "Neutrino Oscillations\nNeutrinos are generated in flavor eingenstate however propagation is done in mass eingenstate, since each planar wave has a different frecuency given their different masses, the neutrino detected (also in flavor eingenstate) will have a different interference pattern than the one generated given rise to neutrino flavor oscillations.\n\nAs a result of these changes in relative phases, neutrinos oscillate from one flavor to another as they travel. Low-energy neutrinos oscillate in a shorter distance than high-energy neutrinos.\nA curious aspect of quantum physics is that only the probability of the flavor of neutrino changes as it travels.\nThe neutrino only becomes a definite flavor when it interacts in a detector - by finding whether an electron, muon, tau is created.\n\n\nThe PMNS Matrix\nThe Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix is the one that relates the mass eingenstates with the flavor eingenstates:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu \\\\ \\nu_\\tau \\end{pmatrix} = U_{PMNS} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\\\ \\nu_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nwith:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_{PMNS} &=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{12}c_{13} & s_{12}c_{13} & s_{13}e^{-i\\delta} \\\\\n-s_{12}c_{23} - c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & c_{12}c_{23} - s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & s_{23}c_{13} \\\\\ns_{12}s_{23} - c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & -c_{12}s_{23} - s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & c_{23}c_{13} \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\\\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\\delta} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & 0 & c_{13}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\\\ -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_{ij} = \\sin \\theta_{ij}\\), \\(c_{ij} = \\cos \\theta_{ij}\\). The term \\(\\delta\\) is a CP violation term, if \\(s_{13} = 0\\) we won’t be able to measure \\(\\delta\\) as it always multiplies \\(s_{13}\\)\n\n\nThe 2-flavor mixing case\nLet’s assume 2 flavor eigenstates identified as rotations of 2 mass eigenstates:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) is called the mixing angle.\nThe mass eigenstates evolve as plane waves with fixed momemtum \\(p\\):\n\\[|\\nu_{i}(t, x)\\rangle = e^{ -i (E_{i} t - p_i x) }|\\nu_{i}(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nLet’s imagine we start at \\((x,t) = (0,0)\\) with a pure beam of \\(\\nu_e\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1(0,0) \\\\ \\nu_2(0,0) \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\\[|\\nu_{1}(0,0)\\rangle = \\cos \\theta\\] \\[|\\nu_{2}(0,0)\\rangle = \\sin \\theta\\]\nand as they evolved:\n\\[|\\nu_{1}(t,x)\\rangle = \\cos \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  }\\] \\[|\\nu_{2}(t,x)\\rangle = \\sin \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) }\\]\nSo after a while the wave form of the \\(\\nu_\\alpha\\) is given by:\n\\[|\\nu_{e}(t, x)\\rangle = \\cos^2 \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  } + \\sin^2 \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) } = A_e\\] \\[|\\nu_{\\mu}(t, x)\\rangle = -\\sin\\theta\\cos \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  } + \\cos\\theta\\sin \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) } = A_e\\]\n\nExample of survival probability for the 2-flavor mixing\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu) = \\left|\\langle \\nu_{\\mu}(t,x)|\\nu_{e}(0,0)\\rangle\\right|^2 &=\\left|\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta (e^{i(E_2 t - p_2 x)} - e^{i(E_1 t -p_1 x)})\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\n\\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta \\left|e^{i(E_2 t - p_2 x)} - e^{i(E_1 t -p_1 x)}\\right|^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nusing \\(e^{\\pm ix} = \\cos x \\pm i\\sin x\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu)&= 2 \\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ( 1 - \\cos (E_2t - p_2x - E_1 t - p_1 x))\\\\\n&= \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{(E_2 - E_1)t - (p_2 - p_1)x }{2}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2 L}{4E}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nusing \\(p_i = \\sqrt{E^2_i -m_i^2}\\sim E_i(1-\\frac{m^2_i}{E_i^2})\\), and in natural units \\(t = x = L\\) we can write the phase difference as:\n\\[(E_2 - E_1)t - (p_2 - p_1)x = (\\frac{m_1^2}{2E_1}-\\frac{m_2^2}{2E_2})L = \\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2L}{2E}\\]\nAnd the survival probability is:\n\\[P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e)  = 1 - P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu) = 1- \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2 L}{4E}\\right)\\]\nReplacing \\(\\hbar\\) and \\(c\\) the expression can be written as:\n\\[P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e)  = 1 - \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2\\left[1.27 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta m^2_{12}}{\\mathrm{eV}^2}\\right)\\frac{L/\\mathrm{km}}{E/\\mathrm{GeV}}\\right]\\]\nWe assumed that the mass eigenstates are created with the same energy or momentum and so \\(E_i = E_j\\).This assumption is not necessary and it comes from the fact we use the plane wave approximation. Using the correct formalism of wave packets the result is the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Plot the survival probability of \\(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e\\)\n\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport numpy as np\nplt.rcParams['font.family'] = \"STIXGeneral\"\nplt.rcParams.update({'axes.labelsize': 20})\nplt.rcParams.update({'legend.fontsize': 20})\nplt.rcParams.update({'figure.figsize': [8, 6]})\nplt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 18\nplt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 18\nplt.rcParams['xtick.major.width'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['xtick.minor.width'] = 1\nplt.rcParams['xtick.major.pad'] = 8\nplt.rcParams['xtick.direction'] = 'in'\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.size'] = 10\nplt.rcParams['ytick.minor.size'] = 5\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.width'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['ytick.minor.width'] = 1\nplt.rcParams['ytick.major.pad'] = 8\nplt.rcParams['ytick.direction'] = 'in'\nplt.rcParams['legend.frameon'] = False\nplt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5\nplt.rcParams['axes.linewidth'] = 1.5\n\nimport astropy.units as u\n\nL = 180 # km\n\ndelta_m_sun = 7.0e-5 # eV^2\nsin_square_theta_12 = 0.84 #maximum mixing\n\n\ndef prob_survival(E, L):\n    return 1 - sin_square_theta_12 * np.sin(1.27*delta_m_sun * L / E)**2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,4))\nax.set_ylim(0,1)\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\nu (\\mathrm{ MeV})$\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"$P_{ee}$\")\n\nE = np.linspace(0.1, 15, 1000) #in MeV\n\nax.plot(E, prob_survival(E*1e-3,L), lw=2, \n        label=\"L = %i km\\n\"%L+r\"$P_{ee} = 1 -\\sin^2 2\\theta\\sin^2(\\Delta m^2L/4E_\\nu)$\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"best\")\nax.grid()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually at low enough E / long baselines, neutrino beam becomes fully mixed and energy resolution and source extent conspire to produce 50/50 beam.\n\ny, x = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(50,180,100), np.linspace(0.1, 15, 100) )\nz = prob_survival(x*1e-3,y)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\nimg = ax.pcolormesh(x, y, z, cmap = 'RdBu', shading='auto')\n\ncax = fig.colorbar(img)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Distance (km)\")\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\nu (\\mathrm{ MeV})$\")\ncax.set_label(\"Probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Case for Oscillations\nTaking greek letters of the flavor eingenstates and latin letter the mass eingenstates we can write:\n\\[|\\nu_\\alpha(x,t)\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} |\\nu_k (x,t)\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} e^{-i\\Phi_k}|\\nu_k (0,0)\\rangle\\]\ninverting the mixing matrix we have:\n\\[|\\nu_k (0,0)\\rangle =\\sum_\\gamma U^*_{\\gamma  k} |\\nu_\\gamma(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nputting it in the equation above:\n\\[|\\nu_\\alpha(x,t)\\rangle =\\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} e^{-i\\Phi_k}\\sum_\\gamma U^*_{\\gamma  k} |\\nu_\\gamma(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nIf we want to evaluate the probability of finding a neutrino \\(\\beta\\) when we had \\(\\alpha\\) is the transition amplitude is given by:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{A}(\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta(x,t)) &= \\langle \\nu_\\beta(x,t)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle \\\\\n&= \\sum_\\gamma \\sum_k U_{\\gamma k}e^{i\\Phi_k}U^*_{\\beta k}\\langle \\nu_\\gamma(0,0)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle \\\\\n&= \\sum_k U_{\\alpha  k}e^{i\\Phi_k}U^*_{\\beta k}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere we used the fact that flavor eingenstates are ortogonal and hence \\(\\langle \\nu_\\gamma(0,0)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle = \\delta_{\\gamma,\\alpha}\\).\nThe oscillation probability is then:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = |\\mathcal{A}(\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta(x,t))|^2 &= \\left|\\sum_k U_{\\alpha i}e^{i\\Phi_i}U^*_{\\beta i}\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\\sum_i U_{\\alpha i}e^{i\\Phi_i}U^*_{\\beta i}\\sum_j U^*_{\\alpha j}e^{-i\\Phi_j}U_{\\beta j}\\\\\n&=\\sum_j\\sum_i U_{\\alpha i}U^*_{\\beta i}U^*_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}e^{-i(\\Phi_j-\\Phi_i)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi_i = E_i t- p_i x\\) and so:\n\\[\\Phi_i - \\Phi_j = (E_i - E_j)t - (p_i -p_j)x\\]\nusing \\(p_i = \\sqrt{E^2_i -m_i^2}\\sim E_i(1-\\frac{m^2_i}{E_i^2})\\) we can write the phase difference as:\n\\[\\Phi_i - \\Phi_j = (\\frac{m_i^2}{2E_i}-\\frac{m_j^2}{2E_j})L = \\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^2L}{2E}\\]\nwhere we used the fact that at relativistic speeds \\(t = x = L\\) and a dodgy approximation where we assumed that the mass eigenstates are created with the same energy or momentum and so \\(E_i = E_j\\).This assumption is not necessary, but we find that whatever assumption is made you get the the same result. The fact that we have to make such an approximation comes from the way that we are modelling the mass eigenstates as plane waves. If we were to do the analysis assuming that the mass states were wavepackets instead we would not need the equal momentum (equal energy) assumption and would still get the same answer.\nWith this we can rewrite the oscillation probability as:\n\\[\\begin{matrix}P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta)=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} & - & 4{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Re}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*}})\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{4E})\\\\ & + & {\\displaystyle 2\\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Im}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*})\\sin(}\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{2E}),\\end{matrix}\\]\nFor \\(\\delta = 0\\) the last term is 0.\n\n\nAbout symmetries.\n\nConsequences of CPT invariance:\n\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\alpha})\\]\n\nConditions of CP invariance:\n\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) \\]\n\nCondition os T invariance:\n\n\\[P({\\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\nu_\\beta}) = P({\\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\nu_\\alpha})\\mathrm{\\; and\\; }P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\bar\\nu_\\alpha})\\]\nOnly if \\(U\\) is not real we can have CP violation effects ie:\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) - P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) ={ 4 \\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Im}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*})\\sin(}\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{2E})\\]\n\n\nMass hierarchy\nBut this means that neutrinos oscillations can be described in terms of 6 parameters: \\(\\theta_{12}\\), \\(\\theta_{13}\\) and \\(\\theta_{23}\\) plus 2 mass-squared differences, \\(\\Delta m_{12}^2\\) and \\(\\Delta m_{32}^2\\) and one CP violating phase \\(\\delta_{CP}\\). Althought we can measured the mass-squared differences in neutrino oscillation experiments, we cannot know the absolute scales nor the mass hierarchy.\n\n\n\nSource: arXiv:1205.2671\n\n\nWhere \\(\\Delta m_{12}^2 = \\Delta m_{Sol}^2\\) and \\(\\Delta m_{31(2)}^2 = \\Delta m_{atm}^2\\).

The combined effect is:\n\\[4p \\rightarrow ^4He + 2e^+ 2\\nu_e\\]\nFrom the beginning of the solar-neutrino observation a deficit of the electron neutrino predicted by the Standard Solar Model was observed: the solar-neutrino problem\nIn 1999 SNO in Canada started taking data. This experiment was able to detect \\(\\nu_e\\) by CC interactions and \\(\\nu_x\\) by NC interaction solving the mistery of the solar-neutrino problem. It is now understood as a neutrino flavor oscillation. The results of SNO together with KamLAND (a long baseline neutrino detector) confirmed the Large Mixing Angle solution (LMA) of the solar sector:\n\\[\\sin^2 \\theta_{12} \\simeq 0.30\\] \\[\\Delta m_{12}^2 \\equiv \\Delta m_{\\odot}^2 \\simeq 8 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{ \\; eV^2}\\]\n\n\nAtmospheric Neutrinos\nFirst evidence of atmospheric neutrino oscillations came from Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. By scanning in zenith angle, is like changing the \\(L\\).\n\nIf atmospheric mixing is non-maximal, it remains to determine in which “octant” the mixing angle \\(\\theta_{23}\\) lies. For a \\(\\theta_{23}\\) in the first octant (\\(&lt; 45^{\\circ}\\)) the mass eigenstate \\(\\nu_3\\) is tau heavy, i.e., the tau neutrino fraction is larger than the muon neutrino fraction. Conversely, for a \\(\\theta_{23}\\) in the second octant (\\(&gt; 45^{\\circ}\\)) the state \\(\\nu_3\\) is muon heavy.\n\n\nReactor Neutrinos\n\nDouble Chooz: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.109 \\pm 0.030 \\pm 0.025 \\neq 0\\) at \\(2.9\\sigma\\)\nDaya Bay: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.089 \\pm 0.010 \\pm 0.005 \\neq 0\\) at \\(7.7\\sigma\\)\nRENO: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.113 \\pm 0.013 \\pm 0.019 \\neq 0\\) at \\(4.9\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\n\nNeutrino oscillations in matter.\nThe \\(U_{PMNS}\\) matrix must be modified to account for the the fact that electron neutrinos have an extra interaction not present for \\(\\nu_\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu_\\tau\\) when travelling through matter. Elastic scattering of \\(\\nu_e\\) on electron can occur via exchange of a charged \\(W\\)-boson as well as by exchange of the neutral \\(Z\\)-boson adding a term \\(V_e = G_F \\sqrt{2}N_e\\) in the mass differences for electrons.\nWithout entering in the maths, what happens here is that a resonance effect occurs, ie, even if the mixing angle is small in vacuum it can get amplified in matter. This resonance can be expressed as a condition on the electron density \\(N_e\\) which is appropriate for systems such as stellar interiors (Sun or supernovae too) where provided the core density is high enough, there is always a region in the neutrinos’ path exiting the star where it passes through resonance.\nThis is known as the MSW effect for the theorists who discovered it - Mikheyev, Smirnov, and Wolfenstein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial II: Calculate the probabilities of \\(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_x\\) as function of L/E\n\n\n\n\ndef PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, d):\n    s12 = np.sin(t12)\n    c12 = np.cos(t12)\n    s23 = np.sin(t23)\n    c23 = np.cos(t23)\n    s13 = np.sin(t13)\n    c13 = np.cos(t13)\n    cp  = np.exp(1j*d)\n    return np.array([[ c12*c13, s12*c13, s13*np.conj(cp) ],\n                  [-s12*c23 - c12*s23*s13*cp, c12*c23 - s12*s23*s13*cp, s23*c13],\n                  [ s12*s23 - c12*s23*s13*cp,-c12*s23 - s12*c23*s13*cp, c23*c13]])\ndef posc(a, b, U, dm2, LEratio):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gives the oscillation probability for nu(a) -&gt; nu(b)\n    for PMNS matrix U, and L in km and E in GeV, and dm2 in eV^2\n    \"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    for j in range(2):\n        for i in range(j+1, 3):\n            arg = 5.068*dm2[i+j-1]*LEratio\n            mxe = np.conj(U[a,i])*U[b,i]*U[a,j]*np.conj(U[b,j])\n            s += -4*mxe.real*np.sin(0.25*arg)**2 + 2*mxe.imag*np.sin(0.50*arg)\n    if a == b: s += 1.0\n    return s\nt12 = np.arcsin(0.312**0.5)\nt13 = np.arcsin(0.0251**0.5) #Controlls the size of the small wiggles.\n#t13 = np.arcsin(0.0)\nt23 = np.arcsin(0.42**0.5)\n\ndm2 = [ 7.58E-05, 2.27E-03, 2.35E-03]\ndelta = 0\n\nU = PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, delta)\n\n\nLE = np.linspace(0, 36000, 3600)\nPe = posc(0, 0, U, dm2, LE)\nPm = posc(0, 1, U, dm2, LE)\nPt = posc(0, 2, U, dm2, LE)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4))\nax.plot(LE, Pe, '-', label=r'$\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e$')\nax.plot(LE, Pm, 'k', label=r'$\\nu_e\\rightarrow\\nu_\\mu$')\nax.plot(LE, Pt, 'r', label=r'$\\nu_e\\rightarrow\\nu_\\tau$')\nax.set_xlabel(\"L/E (km/GeV)\")\nax.set_ylabel(r\"Probability $\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_x$\")\nax.set_ylim(0,1)\nax.grid()\nplt.legend(loc=\"best\")\nplt.show()",

    "text": "Spectral Energy Distribution\nAs we saw, the origin of CR remains a mystery due to the deflection of CRs in their travel. Only CR astronomy at \\(10^{19}\\) eV will be possible if the composition of these UHECR are protons, but even in this case the GZK limits the horizon.\nGamma-ray astronomy provides an fundamental tool to observe the Universe using neutral deep penetrating gamma-ray particles. Originally the distinction between gamma-rays and X-rays was due to the nuclear production mechanism. X-rays are the product of transition of electrons in the atomic shell, while gamma-rays are produced in the atomic nucleus. This distinction also leads to a classification in energy. X-rays are typically below 100 keV. Photons with E &gt; 100 keV are called gamma-rays.\nIn gamma-ray astronomy is usual to study an object emission by its spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED on an object is its energy emitted plotted against some measure of the photon - frequency or wavelength. The reason astronomers do this is to see how much energy is produced by the object as a function of frequency or wavelength. The SED is typically characterized by \\(\\nu F_\\nu\\) and it is measured in units of ergs \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\; \\mathrm{s}\\;^{-1}\\), ie. it indicates the rate of energy emitted per surface. The function \\(F_\\nu\\) is the flux density which indicates the rate of energy emitted per surface and also per frequency, so it is expressed as ergs \\(\\mathrm{cm^{-2}\\; s^{-1}\\; Hz^{-1}}\\). All of this doesn’t need to be confused with the spectrum! which is what we are being using to characterize CRs. In CR physics spectrum in the rate of particles per unit energy and surface and it is measured on \\(\\mathrm{GeV^{-1}\\; cm^{-2}\\; s^{-1}}\\). The spectrum multiply by energy, gives you the rate of particles per unit surface. Multiplying again by energy give use the energy rate per unit surface. Therefore we have the relation:\n\\[\\nu F_\\nu = E^2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}E}\\]",

    "text": "Leptonic models\n\nSynchrotron radiation\nSynchrotron radiation is extremely important for astrophysics as it was realized by Shklovskii in 1957 when studing the non-thermal emission of the Crab remnant. In order to understand better the synchrotron radiation we will have to dig in a bit in electromagnetism. We already saw that a charge particle of charge \\(q\\), for example an electron, moving with velocity \\(v\\) in a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) feels an an external force:\n\\[\\vec{F} = \\frac{q}{c}(\\vec{v}\\times \\vec{B}) \\]\nNow, because of the force on the particle is perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field cannot do work on the particle, and so its speed does not change, i.e. \\(|v|\\) = constant, but there is an acceleration since the direction will change. On the other hand an accelerated electrical charge radiates electromagnetic waves! which… will slow down the particle…\nThe reason of this aparent inconsistency comes from the fact that we treat the electric field lines as the purely Coulombic action-at-a-distance. In reality we have to take into account that as a particle moves, the electric field lines need to re-arrange and this re-arrangement cannot happen at a speed faster than the speed of light.\nHere are going to derive the radiation emission for a particle with an acceleration and we are going to do it by messing around with the Coulomb fields. For a more formal argument derived from Maxwell equations you can see the book of Longair.\nLet’s assume that the particle is at rest at the moment \\(t=0\\). The electric field lines clearly point away from the origin. At that moment the particle accelerates which brings the velocity of the particle to \\(\\Delta v\\) in a time \\(\\Delta t\\), after that the particle continues with uniform velocity.\n\nAfter a certain time, the particle will be in the position \\(t\\Delta v\\). In a sphere located far way (with a radius larger than \\(c t\\)), the electric field lines are still those of the stacionary particle, since they field lines cannot “know” yet that the particle has moved, so the point radially towards the origin at \\(t=0\\). Inside a sphere of radius \\(c(t - \\Delta t\\)), the electric field lines are already those from the electron that moves at a constant velocity.\nThe perturbation of the electric field lines needs to propagate radially, this kink is nothing more than a radiation! From simple geometry relations we can get that:\n\\[\\frac{E_\\theta}{E_{r}} = \\frac{\\Delta v  t \\sin\\theta}{c\\Delta t} = \\frac{r \\sin \\theta}{c^2}\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\\]\nwhere \\(r = c t\\), and \\(E_r\\) is simply the Coulomb field \\(E_r = q/4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2\\) or in gaussian units since the kink is really small and the eletric field along the kink remains the same \\(E_r = q/r^2\\) and therefore the transverse component becomes:\n\\[E_\\theta = \\frac{q a \\sin\\theta}{c^2 r}\\]\nwhere we used the fact that \\(\\Delta v/\\Delta t\\) is just the acceleration \\(a\\). An interesting fact appears here, \\(E_\\theta\\) depends on \\(r^{-1}\\) and not \\(r^{-2}\\) so for larger \\(r\\), \\(E_\\theta\\) is going to dominate over \\(E_r\\). Accompanying this transverse electric field there will be a magnetic field, which is a property of an electromagnetic wave. In other words, an electromagnetic pulse is generated by the accelerated charge particle. Since this is an electromagnetic radiation there is an energy flow per unit area, per second and the direction is given by the Poynting vector (with \\(|E|=|B|\\) as in electromagnetic wave):\n\\[\\vec{S}  = \\frac{c}{4\\pi}(\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B})\\]\nWhich points in the radial direction. In this case can be reduced to:\n\\[|S| \\equiv \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t \\mathrm{d}A} = \\frac{c}{4\\pi} E^2_\\theta \\vec{n}\\]\nWhich is the energy flow per unit area per second. The unit area \\(\\mathrm{d}A\\) can be rewritten in terms of the solid angle as \\(\\mathrm{d} A= r^2\\mathrm{d}\\Omega\\), and so the rate of energy loss through the area subtended by the solid angle \\(\\mathrm{d} \\Omega\\) at distance \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t \\mathrm{d} \\Omega}\\right)_{rad}  = \\frac{q^2a^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{4\\pi c^3}\\]\nNotice that this energy loss rate follows a dipole pattern \\(\\mathrm{d}P/\\mathrm{d}\\Omega \\propto \\sin^2 \\theta\\) and that \\(\\theta\\) is defined along the acceleration line. If we now integrate over all solid angles we obtain that the emitted power is given by:\n\\[P \\equiv -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)_{rad} = \\frac{2q^2 a^2 }{3c^3}\\]\nWhich is call the Larmor’s formula. Note that this is valid for any form of acceleration \\(a\\).\nIn the relativistic case this formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[P  = \\frac{2q^2}{3c^3} \\gamma^4 [ \\gamma^2 a_{\\parallel}^2 + a^2_{\\perp}] \\]\n\n\nSingle-electron in uniform magnetic field\nIn an uniform magnetic field, a high energy charged particle, for example an electron, moves in spiral path at a constant pitch angle, \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIts velocity along the field lines is constant \\(v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos\\alpha = \\mathrm{const.}\\), but its circular component \\(v_\\perp = v\\sin\\alpha\\). Let’s first attack the non-relativistic case.\n\n\nNon relativistic case: Cyclotron radiation\nFrom Newton’s law and the Lorentz force we have that:\n\\[ m_e a_\\perp = m_e \\frac{v_\\perp^2}{r_{gyr}} = \\frac{e v_\\perp B}{c}\\]\nwhere \\(r_{gyr}\\) is the gyroradius which can be written as:\n\\[r_{gyr} = \\frac{v_\\perp}{\\omega_{gyr}} = \\frac{v\\sin\\alpha}{\\omega_{gyr}}\\]\nwhere we can define the gyrofrecuency as:\n\\[\\omega_{gyr} \\equiv \\frac{eB}{m_e c}\\]\nTherefore according to the Larmor’s equation of power emitted we can write:\n\\[P = \\frac{2 e^2}{3c^3} \\omega_{gyr}^2 v^2\\sin^2\\alpha\\]\nNote the Larmor formula does not tell us frequency spectrum, but if a particle is moving in a circular motion, then from an observer far way, the “aparent” motion will be sinosoidal as illustrated in the figure below.\n\nIn particular since the power \\(P\\) depends on \\(|v^2|\\) for a distance in the \\(x-y\\) plane, power will varie as \\(\\sin^2(\\omega_{gyr}t)\\) and so the electric field line will change as \\(E(t)\\propto \\sin(\\omega_{gyr}t)\\). The radiated emission will appear as monochromatic with an angular frequency given precisely by the particle circular frequency \\(\\omega_{gyr}\\). This is the known as the cyclotron radiation. In this case the dipole emission pattern is turning around with the particle and an observer in the laboratory frame will see the same frequency. As a consequence also the radiation is independent of the viewing angle.\n\n\nRelativistic case: Synchrotron radiation.\nThings are slighly different when we consider the relativistic case where electrons move at \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 1\\). Using again Newton’s law with the Lorentz force we have:\n\\[\\gamma m_e \\frac{\\mathrm{d} v_\\perp}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{e v_\\perp B}{c}\\]\nwhere we can obtain the perpendicular acceleration as:\n\\[a_\\perp = \\frac{e v\\sin\\alpha}{\\gamma m_e c}\\]\nwhere now the electrons’s relatisvistic angular gyroradius frequency is given by:\n\\[\\omega^{rel}_{gyr} \\equiv \\frac{eB}{\\gamma m_e c}\\]\nwhich is exactly related to the classical angular frequency as \\(\\omega_{gyr}/\\gamma\\). According to the relativistic Larmor’s formula above we have that:\n\\[P = \\frac{2 e^2}{3c^3} \\gamma^4 \\left(\\frac{e v\\sin\\alpha}{\\gamma m_e c}\\right)^2 \\]\nWe can re-arrange this formula by assuming ultra-relativistic electrons \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 1\\) and that we have an average number of electrons with different pitch angles and so \\(\\langle \\sin^2 \\alpha \\rangle = 2/3\\). We are going also to use the definition of the Thomson cross-section:\n\\[\\sigma_T \\equiv \\frac{8\\pi}{3}r^2_0\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the electron classic radius defined (in gaussian units) as:\n\\[r_0 = \\frac{e^2}{m_e c^2} \\]\nwith that we can write the power loss as:\n\\[P = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c U_B \\gamma^2\\]\nwhere \\(U_B = B^2/8\\pi\\) is the magnetic field energy density. The power depends on the electron mass via the Thomson cross-section and the \\(\\gamma\\). In total it gives \\(P\\propto m_e^{-4}\\) for the electrons. That’s why for protons the syncrotron radiation is not as important as it is for electrons. The mean free-path for electrons given their losses sue to synchrotron is (for typical astrophysical values):\n\\[l_{syn} = \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right)^{-1}  \\sim 100 \\mathrm{\\;pc}\\]\nThat’s the reason why electrons are not the main component of CR since the cannot travel long distances. If we want now to derive the power emitted per frequency, things get also a bit more complicated. One first thing to take into account is that in the relativistic regime the power radiated will be distorted. From Lorentz transformations we can derive that an angle \\(\\Psi\\) in the particle rest frame will be seen in laboratory frame as:\n\\[\\sin \\Psi = \\frac{\\sin\\Psi^\\prime}{\\gamma(1+\\beta \\cos\\Psi^\\prime)}\\]\n(we saw this in the Exercises 1). For small angles we have that\n\\[\\sin \\Psi \\sim \\Psi \\sim \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\]\ni.e, while the power is radiated nearly isotropically (dipole) in the particle’s instantaneus rest frame, most of it will be beamed into a narrow cone of angle \\(\\sim 1/\\gamma\\) in the laboratory frame. Note that I’m referring to an instantaneous rest frame, what does it even mean? Well it means that I in the particle rest frame, where the velocity of the particle is 0, the acceleration on the other hand is not 0, so eventually the particle will move. Ie, there is no particle rest frame, but there is an instantaneous rest frame.\nThis beaming in the lab reference frame has an impact on how the viewer sees the electric field variation. It is no longer a sinusoidal, instead the emission is pulsed every time the cone sweeps around the line of sight of an observer as illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\nSince each cone beaming has a half amplidude of \\(1/\\gamma\\) the radiation from an observer is visible during a \\(\\Delta \\theta \\sim 2/\\gamma\\). During this angular distance the particle travels from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) at an angular frequency given by \\(\\omega_{gyr}^{rel}\\) which means that \\(\\Delta t_{AB}\\) is given by:\n\\[\\Delta t_{AB} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\omega_{gyr}^{rel}} = \\frac{2}{\\gamma \\omega_{gyr}^{rel}}\\]\nGiven the relativistic speed of the the electron, the frequency of the radiation is no longer a sinusoidal. When a photon is emitted at the point \\(B\\) the photon emitted in \\(A\\) has already travelled a distance \\(c\\Delta t_{AB}\\). Therefore the time interval between photons is given by:\n\\[\\Delta t_{sync} = \\frac{c\\Delta t_{AB} - v_\\perp \\Delta t_{AB}}{c} \\approx \\Delta t_{AB}( 1 - \\beta) \\approx  \\Delta t_{AB} \\frac{1 - \\beta^2}{1 + \\beta} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta t_{sync} \\approx \\frac{ \\Delta t_{AB} }{2\\gamma^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^3 \\omega_{gyr}^{rel}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2 \\omega_{gyr}} \\]\nSo synchrotron radiation is a very spiky series of widely spaced narrow pulses of time \\(2\\Delta t_{sync}\\), and adjacent spikes are separated in frequency \\(\\Delta t_{gyr} = 1/\\nu^{rel}_{gyr} = \\gamma/\\nu_{gyr}\\). The emission from an observer is illustrated below:\n\nThe power spectrum (ie power as function of frequency) illustrated in the plot on the right is no long a monochromatic sinusoidal signal, but the Fourier transform of this time series of pulses. Taking of all the Fourier components into account results in the following expression for one electron (the formal derivation can be found for example in Classical Electrodynamics by J. D. Jackson):\n\\[P(\\nu)\\mathrm{d}\\nu = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}e^3B\\sin\\alpha}{m_ec^2}\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_c}\\int_{\\nu/\\nu_c}^\\infty K_{5/3}(\\psi)\\mathrm{d}\\psi\\]\nwhere \\(K_{5/2}\\) is the Bessel function of order 5/2, and we expressed the power spectrum in terms of the frequency \\(\\nu = \\nu_{gyr} =\\omega_{gyr}/2\\pi\\) and where we defined the critical frequency as:\n\\[\\nu_c \\equiv \\frac{3}{2}\\gamma^2\\nu_{gyr} \\sin \\alpha\\]\nwhich the frequency at which the power spectrum will peak. In general terms we can describe the shape of the synchrotron power spectrum of a single electron has a logarithmic slope at low frequencies as \\(P \\propto \\nu^{1/3}\\), a broad peak near the critical frequency \\(\\nu_c\\), and a sharp fall off at higher frequencies.\n\nSpectrum for several electrons for optically thin sources\nIf a synchrotron source containing any arbitrary distribution of electron energies is optically thin (\\(\\tau \\ll 1\\)), then its spectrum is the superposition of the spectra from individual electrons and its flux density cannot rise faster than \\(\\nu^{1/3}\\) at any frequency \\(\\nu\\). The energy distribution of cosmic-ray electrons in most synchrotron sources is roughly a power law:\n\\[n(E) \\mathrm{d}E \\propto E^{-\\delta}\\mathrm{d}E\\]\nWe make the very simple and crude approximation that each electron radiates all of its power at a single critical frequency:\n\\[\\nu_c \\simeq \\gamma^2\\nu_{gyr}\\]\nWe can assume that the luminosity or total power emitted per unit volume per unit frequency, \\(L(\\nu)\\mathrm{d}\\nu\\) is given by the power emitted for each individual electron times the number of electrons:\n\\[ L (\\nu) \\mathrm{d}\\nu = P n(E)\\mathrm{d}E = -\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) n(E)\\mathrm{d}E \\]\nwhere \\[E = \\gamma m_e c^2 \\simeq \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{gyr}}\\right)^{1/2}m_e c^2\\]\nand so\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu} \\simeq \\frac{m_e c^2 \\nu^{-1/2}}{2\\nu_{gyr}^{1/2}}\\]\nputting all together gives:\n\\[L_\\nu \\propto B^{(\\delta+1)/2}\\nu^{(1-\\delta)/2}\\]\nThat is, the synchrotron spectrum of a power-law energy distribution is itself a power law. This idea is represented in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example in our Galaxy we expect the electron population to have an spectral index of \\(\\delta \\sim 2.4\\), and so the synchrotron radiation should have an spectral index of \\(\\sim 0.7\\).\n\n\nPower spectrum for several electrons for optically thick sources\nThe argument of a power law synchrotron spectrum as a power-low with specltral index \\(\\alpha = (1 - \\delta)/2\\) it’s true as long as no absorption of photons by the emitting region happens. At low frequencies however synchrotron suffers from self-absorption, in which a photon interacts with a charge in a magnetic field. This also happens in optically thick sources. Therefore at low frequencies its emission is absorbed and re-emitted as blackbody radiation. The derivation of the synchrotron self-absorption is complicated so we are going to give only an heuristic approach. The problem with the re-emission of low frequencies as a black-body radiation is that a power-law distribution does not have a characteristic temperature. We can however assume that each electrons emits energy at a given frequency (given that the synchrotron emission of individual electrons is highly peak at a given frequency):\n\\[\\nu_c \\equiv \\frac{3}{2}\\gamma^2\\nu_{gyr} \\sin \\alpha\\]\nin order to calculate an effective temperature we can use that for an ultrarelativistic gas we have the relation:\n\\[E_e = 3kT_e(\\nu)\\]\nwhere \\(E_e = \\gamma m_e c^2\\), since \\(\\gamma \\propto \\nu^{1/2}\\) we have that:\n\\[T_e(\\nu) \\propto \\nu^{1/2}\\]\nThe black-body radiation or Rayleigh-Jeans is proportional to \\(\\nu^2\\) but given the extra dependency of \\(T_e(\\nu)\\) it is changed as:\n\\[L(\\nu) \\propto T(\\nu) \\nu^2 B^{-1/2} \\sim \\nu^{1/2}\\nu^{2}B^{-1/2} \\sim \\nu^{5/2} B^{-1/2}\\]\nA thing to note is that this part of the spectrum is independent of the orginal electron power-law spectral index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Working with SED using naima\n\n\n\nWe are going to plot some SED using a python module called naima.

In astrophysics the inverse Compton effect electrons accelerated to high energy collide with photons from the blackbody radiation (thermal photons) or starlight photons and transfer energy to them.\nIn astrophysics the inverse compton scattering is very important as a fast electrons that produce the synchrotron component can hit a low-energy photon and transfer a large fraction of its energy to the photon. For low energy photons, the scattering is elastic, and this regime is called the classical Thomson regime. However, for high energy photons where \\(E_\\gamma \\gg m_e c^2\\) the scatting is not elastic and the energy of the scattered photons changes. This regime is called the Klein-Nishina. The cross-section for this inelastic scattering is given by:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} \\sigma_{KN}}{\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega} = \\frac{r_e^2}{2} \\frac{E^2_{\\gamma,out}}{E^2_{\\gamma,in}}\\left(\\frac{E_{\\gamma,out}}{E_{\\gamma,in}} + \\frac{E_{\\gamma,in}}{E_{\\gamma,out}} - \\sin^2\\theta\\right)\\]\nIn the low energy regime \\(E_{\\gamma,in} = E_{\\gamma,out}\\) and the cross-section approaches that of the Thomson scattering.\n\nMaximum energy of inverse Compton\nLet’s assume the lab reference system, \\(O\\), and the electrons rest frame system \\(O^\\prime\\). The energy of the photon is then given by:\n\\[E_{\\gamma,in}^\\prime = \\gamma E_{\\gamma,in} (1 + \\beta \\cos\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\beta\\) refer obviously to the electron. Since in the electron’s rest frame the scattering happens at low-energy we can assume that the scattering is described by the elastic Thomson regime, ie, the photon is scattered with the same energy in the electron’s rest frame. Going back to the lab frame we have then:\n\\[E_{\\gamma,out} = \\gamma E_{\\gamma,out}^\\prime ( 1 + \\beta\\cos\\theta^\\prime)\\]\nbut \\(E_{\\gamma,in}^\\prime = E_{\\gamma,out}^\\prime\\). The maximum energy transfer will be that of a head-on collision in which the electron \\(\\cos\\theta = \\cos \\theta^\\prime = 1\\) is bounced backwards we have that:\n\\[\\nu_{max} = \\nu_0 \\gamma^2 ( 1 + \\beta)^2 \\simeq 4 \\nu_0 \\gamma^2\\]\nAs electrons are moving in an isotropic photon field the will see mostly head on collitions. So the energy spectrum of of scattered photons peak close to the maximum frecuency. This relation is very important for astrophysics, because it tell us a relation between the energy of electrons and the spectrum of photons. We know there are electrons with \\(\\gamma \\sim 100 - 1000\\) and therefore the resulting photon emission is of very high energy. For example assuming electrons with \\(\\gamma \\approx 1000\\) we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaveband\nFrequency (Hz) \\(\\nu_0\\)\nScattered Frequency (Hz)\n\n\n\n\nRadio\n\\(10^9\\)\n\\(10^{15}\\) = UV\n\n\nFar-infrared\n\\(3\\times10^{12}\\)\n\\(3\\times10^{18}\\) = X-rays\n\n\nOptical\n\\(4\\times10^{14}\\)\n\\(4\\times10^{21}\\) = \\(\\gamma\\)-rays\n\n\n\nThe hand-waving argument \\(\\nu \\sim \\nu_0 \\gamma^2\\) has also implication on the spectrum of photons.

When external photons are present IC does not need the synchrotron field.

Because blazars have their jets pointing towards, the full emission comes from a relatively small region (the width of the jets) and so these objects can exhibit rapid variability (due to the smaller causally connected regions). The typical SED for AGNS is characterized by a synchrotron component extending from radio to X-ray frequencies, and a second component peaking at gamma-ray frequencies due to either inverse-Compton radiation (or from hadronic processes). The plot below shows the spectral energy distribution of nearby (z = 0.044) blazar 1ES 2344+514 during a flaring and a quiet state.\n\n\n\n\n\nLightcurves and flares\nIn addition to the SED one could measure the light-curve or number of photons (or energy density) as a function of time. This is usually done to illustrate the variability of the source. For AGNs it is possible to make the lightcurve for different energy ranges, and therefore addressing different emission mechanism.\nSometimes it is possible to observe a flare in high energy photon range but with no activity detected in soft/hard X-ray. These are called orphan flare. This is interesting since in the SSC scenarios the X-rays (due to synchrotron) and TeV gamma-rays (due IC scattering) must be correlated. An orphan flare is therefore an indication that SSC scenario might be excluded, while the EC is still possible. As we will see also an hadronic scenario in which TeV photons come from \\(\\pi^0\\) is still possible.",

As we saw these interactions have a lower threshold than \\(p\\gamma\\). Let’s consider the reaction:\n\\[p + p \\rightarrow p + p + \\pi^0 + \\pi^+ \\pi^-\\]\nwhere we assume that pions are produced with the same probability (1/3). Doing the same calculation as before we get that:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n    I_{\\nu_\\mu}(E_{\\nu_\\mu}) &\\propto 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\langle x_{p\\rightarrow\\nu}\\rangle E_{\\nu_\\mu}^{-2} \\rightarrow 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{20} E_{\\nu_\\mu}^{-2}\\\\\n    I_\\gamma(E_\\gamma) &\\propto 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\\langle x_{p\\rightarrow\\gamma}\\rangle  E_\\gamma^{-2} \\rightarrow  2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{10} E_{\\gamma}^{-2}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nAstrophysical Neutrino Oscillations\nIn the discussion above we focused on muon neutrinos, however we ignored the fact that neutrino oscillate. We saw that the probability of neutrino flavor for \\(\\delta = 0\\) can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) &=\\sum_j\\sum_i U_{\\alpha i}U^*_{\\beta i}U^*_{\\alpha  j}U_{\\beta j}e^{-i\\frac{\\Delta m^2L}{2E}}\\\\\n&= \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}  -  4{\\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Re}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*}})\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{4E})\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nFor a non-monochromatic neutrino beam, the probability has to be averaged over the spectrum. The \\(\\sin\\) term will be averaged to 0.5 for large distances \\(L\\). And thus the probability does not depend on time and can be written as a matrix:\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = \\sum_j |U_{\\alpha  j}|^2 |U_{\\beta j}|^2 \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Calculation of astrophysical neutrino oscillations\n\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\n\ndef PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, d):\n    s12 = np.sin(t12)\n    c12 = np.cos(t12)\n    s23 = np.sin(t23)\n    c23 = np.cos(t23)\n    s13 = np.sin(t13)\n    c13 = np.cos(t13)\n    cp  = np.exp(1j*d)\n    return np.array([[ c12*c13, s12*c13, s13*np.conj(cp) ],\n                  [-s12*c23 - c12*s23*s13*cp, c12*c23 - s12*s23*s13*cp, s23*c13],\n                  [ s12*s23 - c12*s23*s13*cp,-c12*s23 - s12*c23*s13*cp, c23*c13]])\n\n##Probability of flavor change when L-&gt;inf\ndef Prob(a, b, U):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gives the oscillation probability for nu(a) -&gt; nu(b)\n    for PMNS matrix U, and L in km and E in GeV\n    \"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    for i in range(3):\n            s += (np.conj(U[a,i])*U[b,i]*U[a,i]*np.conj(U[b,i])).real\n    return s\n\n\ndef ProbMatrix(U):\n    return np.array([[Prob(0, 0, U), Prob(0, 1, U), Prob(0,2,U)],\n                     [Prob(1, 0, U), Prob(1, 1, U), Prob(1,2,U)],\n                     [Prob(2, 0, U), Prob(2, 1, U), Prob(2,2,U)]])\n                     \n\nt12 = np.arcsin(0.306**0.5)\nt13 = np.arcsin(0.0251**0.5)\nt23 = np.arcsin(0.42**0.5)\nU = PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, 0)\n\nThe probability of a neutrino flavor fector of \\((\\nu^{source}_e, \\nu^{source}_\\mu, \\nu^{source}_\\tau)\\) to change into a flavor vector \\((\\nu^{Earth}_e, \\nu^{Earth}_\\mu, \\nu^{Earth}_\\tau)\\) is given by:\n\\[\\left(\\nu^{Earth}_e \\\\ \\nu^{Earth}_\\mu \\\\ \\nu^{Earth}_\\tau\\right) = P_{\\alpha\\beta} \\left(\\nu^{Source}_e \\\\ \\nu^{Source}_\\mu \\\\ \\nu^{Source}_\\tau\\right)\\]\nAssuming at the source the flavor ratio is (1:2:0) we have that:\n\nProb(0, 0, U) + Prob(1, 0, U) + Prob(2, 0, U)\n\nnp.float64(1.005381376348095)\n\n\n\nsource = np.array([1, 1, 1])\nP = ProbMatrix(U)\nEarth = np.dot(P, source)\nprint (Earth)\n\n[1.00538138 1.00204305 1.00854641]\n\n\nThus, almost equal number of eletron, muon and tau astrophysical neutrinos are expected to be observed at Earth due to oscillations.

The first strong evidence for a cosmic neutrino component came from a search using data from May 2010 to April 2012 [35], where two shower-like events from interactions within the detector with energies above 1 PeV were discovered. A follow-up search for events starting in the detector with more than 30 TeV deposited energy that utilized the same dataset identified 25 additional high-energy events.

    "text": "Starting Events\nNeutrino interactions are identified in IceCube by searching for an interaction vertex within the instrumented volume. This search is sensitive to both shower-like and track-like events. Since the main background for this search is comprised of muons from CR air showers, the rejection strategy is to identify Cherenkov photons from a track entering the detector. For that, the outer parts of the instrumented volume are assigned to a “veto” region. An event is rejected if a certain number of Cherekov photons are found in this veto region at earlier times than the photons produced at the interaction vertex. The energy threshold for this analysis is about \\(E_\\nu \\sim 30\\) TeV.\n\n\nThrough-going muons\nMuons produced in CC neutrino interactions far outside the detector can still reach the instrumented volume to produce track-like events. Even at 1 TeV a muon can penetrate several kilometers of ice before it stops and decays. This allows observation of high-energy neutrino interactions from a much larger volume than the instrumented one, thereby substantially increasing the effective area of the detector.\n\n\nThe spectral fit\nThe results of a combined analysis fits the neutrino flux to a power-law between 27 TeV and 2 PeV consistent with an unbroken power law with a best-fit spectral index given by:\n\\[E^2\\Phi(E) = 2.06^{+0.35}_{-0.26} \\times 10^{-8} \\left(\\frac{E}{100\\;\\mathrm{TeV}}\\right)^{-0.46\\pm 0.12}\\; \\mathrm{GeV\\;s}^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\mathrm{ cm}^{-2}.\\]\nHowever using only the high energy through-going muons (abouve 200 TeV) yields a preferred spectral index of \\(-2.13\\pm 0.13\\)\n\n\nThe Search for Point Sources\nIn the case where the cosmic neutrino flux is dominated by bright individual sources, they should be detectable as a local excess of events on the sky with respect to the atmospheric neutrino and diffuse cosmic neutrino background. The sensitivity of a search for such features depends crucially on the precision by which the direction of the neutrinos can be reconstructed from the data, i.e. on the detector angular resolution. No indication for a neutrino point source has been found in the IceCube data so far. The null result of a point-source of neutrinos, can be transformed into an flux upper limit at a given confidence level. This upper limits represents the neutrino flux that we can be certain to exclude, since IceCube did not see a point source.\n\n\n\nSource: IceCube\n\n\n\n\nThe Olbers’ Paradox\nAltough the most famous formulation of the problem comes from Henrich Olbers (1826), probably it was Kepler in 1610 the first to note that the most obvious observation, the night sky is dark, has very important consequences.\n\nThe idea is quite simple, suppose there is a source population with typical luminosity \\(L\\) in ergs/s and a number density of \\(n\\), then the total power emitted per unit area will be:\n\\[ F = \\int L n \\frac{dV}{4\\pi^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int L n \\mathrm{ d}\\Omega \\mathrm{ d}r\\]\nIntegrating over all distances we can obtain the energy per steradian per second, and assuming the luminosity is independent of distance as well as number density we have that:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} F}{\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} L n \\int_0^{\\infty} \\mathrm{ d}r \\rightarrow \\infty\\]\nThe sky should be bright! The solution of this puzzle is the fact the Universe is dynamic and time dependent! In other words, if the Universe is expanding the radiation from increasingly distant sources is increasingly less. Also stars seems to have had a cosmological evolution, for example, there are more quasars per unit volume at \\(z \\sim 2\\) than now.\nAlthough the Olbers’ paradox is no more a paradox, it represents the problem that arises with neutrino astronomy. Since the extragalactic space is completely transparent for neutrinos, the flux of neutrinos that might arrive at Earth will have a significant contribution from very distant and faint sources. Let’s assume now a source population with typical neutrino luminosity \\(L\\nu(E)\\) and with a number density population given by:\n\\[n(z) = n_0 (1+z)^m\\]\nwhere \\(n_0\\) is the local density of the source population, (ie the population close to our epoch \\(z = 0\\)). The parameter \\(m\\) describes the source cosmological evolution (ie, when sources to appear in the history of the Universe, and how they evolved). Typical values are \\(m= 3\\) for star–formation–like evolution and \\(m=0\\) for no evolution.\nSince the Universe expands and sources move with the Huble flow we are going to use the comoving line of sight distance, defined as (see Lecture 2):\n\\[D_c(z) = \\int_{t}^{t_0} c\\mathrm{ d} t = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int^z_0 \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z^\\prime}{E(z^\\prime)}\\]\nwhere we introduced the function:\n\\[E(z)\\equiv \\sqrt{\\Omega_M(1+z)^4 + \\Omega_r(1+z)^5 + \\Omega_k(1+z)^3 +\\Omega_\\Lambda(1+z)}\\]\nrevisiting the formula of the energy rate of neutrinos per steroradian we have:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} F_\\nu}{\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{c}{H_0}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{L_\\nu(E_\\nu) n_0(1+z)^m}{E(z)} \\mathrm{ d}z\\]\nThe expresion above needs an extra correction. We assumed that energy emitted by the source will be the same at the arrival, however energy will be red-shifted according to \\(E_\\nu (1 + z)\\) so the formula it’s technically:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} F_\\nu}{\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{c}{H_0}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{L_\\nu(E_\\nu(1+z)) n_0(1+z)^m}{E(z)} \\mathrm{ d}z\\]\nAssuming the luminosity follows a power law with, \\(L_\\nu \\propto E^{-\\gamma}\\), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} F_\\nu}{\\mathrm{ d}\\Omega} = \\xi \\frac{c}{H_0} \\frac{L_\\nu(E_\\nu) n_0}{4\\pi} \\]\nwhere the unit-less parameter \\(\\xi\\) is the integral that contains information on the expansion and cosmological evolution of the sources and the spectral index of the sources defined as:\n\\[\\xi = \\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{(1+z)^{(m - \\gamma)}\\mathrm{ d} z}{E(z)}\\]\nAssuming an spectral index of 2, and expressing it as function of the scale factor knowing that:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}z}{1+z} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}a}{a} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{ d}z = -\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}a}{a^2}\\]\nand that \\(z = \\infty \\rightarrow a = 0\\), \\(z = 0 \\rightarrow a = 1\\), we can rewrite the integral as:\n\\[\\xi = \\int_0^{1}\\frac{a^{-m} \\mathrm{ d} a}{E(a)}\\]\nWhere it will depend on the cosmic evolution of the sources. Typical star forming rate evolution (SFR) has an evolution of \\(m = 3.4\\) in our local universe $z&lt;1 $ and \\(m=-0.3\\) for $ 1&lt; z&lt; 4$ and \\(m=-3.5\\) elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial I: Calculate the value of \\(\\xi\\)\n\n\n\nWe are going to calculate the value of the parameter \\(\\xi\\) for different cosmological evolution of the sources.

We can equate this total neutrino flux per steroradian to the flux observed by IceCube (assuming an spectral index of 2):\n\\[\\xi \\frac{c}{H_0} \\frac{L_\\nu(E_\\nu) n_0}{4\\pi} = E^2 \\Phi_\\nu \\sim 2.06 \\times 10^{-8} \\frac{\\mathrm{ GeV}}{\\mathrm{ cm}^2\\mathrm{ s\\;} \\mathrm{ sr}}\\]\n\n#I'm going to use units to avoid stupid mistakes\nimport astropy.units as u\nfrom astropy import constants as const\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\nxi = 0.48\n\nicecube_flux = 2.06e-8 * u.GeV/u.cm**2/u.s/u.sr\n\nLn = icecube_flux * cosmo.H0.to(1/u.s)/const.c.to(u.Mpc/u.s) * 4 * np.pi * u.sr * xi\nLn = Ln.to(u.erg/u.Mpc**3/u.yr)\n\ndisplay(Markdown(r\"$n_0 L_\\nu \\sim$ {0:.1e} {1}\".format(Ln.value, Ln.unit.to_string(\"latex\"))))\n\n\\(n_0 L_\\nu \\sim\\) 1.4e+43 \\(\\mathrm{\\frac{erg}{yr\\,Mpc^{3}}}\\)\n\n\nie, it reaches the value of:\n\\[n_0 L_\\nu \\sim 10^{43} \\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{\\mathrm{Mpc}^3\\mathrm{yr}}\\]\nnote that this is almost independent of the value of \\(xi\\). We can represent this relation in a diagram now called Kowalski’s plot:\n\n\n\nSource: Taken from arxiv:1411.4385\n\n\nConstrains can also be obtained from the point-source limits. The argument is as follows, if the source population that is responsible of the diffuse astrophysical flux observed in IceCube, is rate (has a low density) then the closest of these sources should have provided a signal in the point-source analysis. Let’s assume that \\(d\\) is the distance to the nearest source for a source population with local density \\(n_0\\) so:\n\\[n_0 \\frac{4}{3} \\pi d^3 = 1\\]\nsince there is 1 source in an sphere of radius \\(d\\). We can estimate the closest distance to a source of this population as:\n\\[ d = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi n_0}\\right)^{1/3} \\propto n_0^{-1/3}\\]\nand thus the estimated neutrino flux for this single point-source is:\n\\[E^2 \\Phi^{ps}_\\nu = \\frac{L_\\nu}{4\\pi d^2} \\sim L_\\nu n_0^{2/3}\\]\nA typical value of the neutrino point-source upper limits can be obtained for the Northern sky as:\n\\[E^2 \\Phi^{u.l.}_\\nu \\leq 2 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{ GeV} \\mathrm{ cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{ s}^{-1} \\]\nso we have the 2 constrains together:\n\\[n_0^{-1/3} \\leq \\frac{\\Phi^{u.l.}}{10^{43}\\frac{\\mathrm{erg}}{\\mathrm{Mpc}^3\\mathrm{yr}}}\\]\nwhich leads to the following condition on the local density of sources from the point-source upper limits:\n\nflux_upperlimit = 2e-9 * u.GeV/u.cm**2 / u.s\n\nn0 = np.power(flux_upperlimit/Ln, -3)\nn0 = n0.to(u.Mpc**-3)\n\ndisplay(Markdown(r\"$n_0 \\geq$ {0:.1e} {1}\".format(n0.value, n0.unit.to_string(\"latex_inline\"))))\n\n\\(n_0 \\geq\\) 2.8e-06 \\(\\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}\\)\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHigh energy neutrinos in the context of multimessenger astrophysics.

The average of the time derivative of \\(G\\) is 0 in bound systems, ie, in systems that are holding together forever, like galaxies in galaxy cluster bound by gravity. The virial theorem states that in systems where \\(G\\) is constant, (\\(\\langle \\mathrm{d} G/\\mathrm{d} t \\rangle_\\tau = 0\\)), then:\n\\[\\langle T \\rangle = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum^{N}_{k=1}   \\langle \\vec{F}_k  \\cdot \\vec{r}_k \\rangle \\]\nZwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to infer the existence of unseen matter while examining the Coma galaxy cluster in 1933. In a common case the potential of a system can be described:\n\\[V(r_{kj}) =  \\alpha r_{kj}^n\\]\nwhere the total potential energy is:\n\\[V_{TOT} = \\sum_{k = 1}^N \\sum_{j &gt; k} V (r_{kj}) \\]\nand so the virial theorem can be rewriten as:\n\\[\\langle T \\rangle = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum^{N}_{k=1}   \\langle \\vec{F}_k  \\cdot \\vec{r}_k \\rangle =  \\frac{1}{2} \\sum^{N}_{k=1}\\sum_{j &gt; k} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} V}{\\mathrm{d}r} r_{kj} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum^{N}_{k=1}\\sum_{j &gt; k} n \\alpha r_{kj}^{n-1} r_{kj}\\]\n\\[2\\langle T \\rangle = n \\langle V_{TOT} \\rangle \\]\nin the particular case of gravitational systems we have that \\(n = -1\\). Ie, by measuring the kinetic energy of the system, we can infer the total gravitational potential and hence the mass:\n\\[\\langle V_{TOT} \\rangle = - G_N \\frac{M_{TOT}^2}{\\langle r \\rangle}\\]\nwhile the total kinetic energy can be written as\n\\[\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}M_{TOT}\\langle v^2 \\rangle\\]\nso we can extract the total mass as:\n\\[M_{TOT} \\simeq \\frac{\\langle r \\rangle \\langle v^2 \\rangle}{G_N} \\gg \\sum m_{galaxies} \\]\nwhich for the Coma cluster turned out to be much more than the mass estimated just by simply counting the galaxies in the cluster.\n\n\nAbout Zwicky\nFritz Zwicky was a prolific scientist and made important contributions in many areas of astronomy but he is rather unknown. He coined the term dark matter, supernova and predicted the existence of neutron stars (2 years after the discovery of the neutron)… He also proposed an alternative cosmology explaining the red-shift as tired light.\nHe also believed in re-arranging the planets in the solar system using rockets to make them habitable.\n\n\n\n2. The rotational curves of Galaxies\nIn Kelperian systems, like our solar system, where most of the mass is at the center one can infer the centripital force of a mass orbiting the system as:\n\\[\\frac{m v^2}{r} = G \\frac{m M}{r^2}\\]\nwhere \\(M\\) is the inner mass. In this case the velocity of the orbiting masses \\(m\\) is expected to follow \\(v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r}\\). In the case of spiral galaxies, where the total mass is at the center, the velocity of external objects (like our Sun), was expected to follow the same trend, however it was obsevered that most of the spiral galaxies had rotational velocities of \\(v \\sim \\mathrm{cte}\\). It can be deducted that there is matter density (a halo) that should follow \\(\\rho \\propto r^{-2}\\) in order to explain the constant mass.\nVera Rubin measured the rotation curves of large number of galaxies up to 110 kpc. They all showed the similar behavoir proving that this was an universal feature.\n\nAbout Vera\nMore info on Vera Rubin can be found on wikipedia.\n\n\n\n3. Gravitational lensing\nIn general relativity, the presence of matter (energy density) can curve spacetime, and the path of a light ray will be deflected as a result. This process is called gravitational lensing and in many cases can be described in analogy to the deflection of light by (e.g. glass) lenses in optics.\nThe angle of deviation from gravitational lensing is given by:\n\\[\\alpha = \\frac{4GM}{c^2 b}\\]\nwhere \\(b\\) is the impact parameter or the closest distance.\nThe analysis of the distance in this figure gives the relation:\n\\[D_{LS} \\sin \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(D_s \\sin \\theta_1 - D_s \\sin \\theta_s)\\]\nmaking small angle approximations gives:\n\\[\\alpha D_{LS} = D_s (\\theta_1 - \\theta_s)\\]\ntherefore\n\\[\\theta_s = \\theta_1 - \\frac{4GM}{c^2}\\frac{D_{LS}}{D_s D_L}\\frac{1}{\\theta_1}\\]\nin the particular case of a colinearity between the source and the lens, ie \\(\\theta_s = 0\\), we have:\n\\[\\theta_1 \\equiv \\theta_E = \\left(\\frac{4GM}{c^2}\\frac{D_{LS}}{D_s D_L}\\right)^{1/2}\\]\nwhich is known as the Einstein ring\n\n\n4. Cosmic Microwave Background\nAs we show the microwave background radiation can be decomposed just like sound from a musical instrument can be broken into harmonics. From the features of its power spectrum, i.e. the amount of radiation associated to each frequency, astrophysicists can calculate the quantity of dark matter contained in the Universe. As we saw in Lecture 2, the current cosmological model \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM, has the following components for matter and dark energy:\n\\[\\Omega_\\Lambda \\simeq 0.70, \\;\\;\\; \\Omega_{m} \\simeq 0.30\\]\n\n\n5. Big Bang nucleusintesis (BBN)\nIt is known that the elements observed in the Universe were created in either of two ways:\n\nLight elements (deuterium, helium, and lithium) were produced in the first few minutes of the Big Bang\nHeavier elements than helium are thought to have an stellar origin and be formed much later in the history of the Universe.\n\nRoughly three minutes after the Big Bang itself, the temperature of the Universe who was at roughly \\(10^{32}\\) K cooled down to approximately \\(10^9\\) Kelvin when nucleosynthesis, or the production of light elements, could take place. The prediction of light elements as function of the baryon density can be seen in this plot:\n\nAs can be seen the predictions depend strongly on the baryon density (ie neutrons and protons) at the time of the nucleosynthesis. In particular they depend on the relative abundance of baryons relative to radiation, the baryon-to-photon ratio. Since the photon energy density is well known from the CMB, the observations of primordial abundances of the isotopes of hydrogen, helium and lithium provide a strong constraint on the baryon density. The estimate of baryon density is then \\(\\Omega_b h^2 \\simeq 0.02\\)",

During years, amateur astronomers claimed to have seen the planet. However we know now the precession is explained by Einsteins gravity.\nToday, the search continues for these so-called vulcanoid asteroids. None have been found yet and searches have ruled out asteroids larger than about 6 km. Neither SOHO nor STEREO have detected a planet inside the orbit of Mercury so far.\n\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND)\nWhat if the mass discrepancy can be solved without “adding” matter. In 1983 Mordehai Milgrom proposed that a modified newtonian dynanics could explain the dynamics of galaxies in the small acceleration regime.

    "text": "Dark Matter Candidates\n\nIntroduction\nAssuming that Dark Matter exists, there are some conditions this matter must satify. It must:\n\nstable at least for the life time of the Universe.\nnot interacting electromagnetically (it is dark).\nCan interact weakily\nit must have a density of \\(\\Omega_{DM} \\sim 0.2\\) since: \\[\\Omega_{matter} = \\Omega_{baryon} + \\Omega_{\\nu HDM} + \\Omega_{CDM} \\simeq 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.24 = 0.30 \\]\n\n\n\nThe Boltzman Equation\nImagine that dark matter is a non-interacting, non-relativistic particle with number density given \\(n_\\chi \\propto a^{-3}\\). As the universe expands the density is diluting according to:\n\\[\\frac{d n_\\chi}{dt} = - 3 H n_\\chi\\]\nSince \\(H = da/dt\\). Now let’s imagine that dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the standard model, we are talking here about “chemical” equilibrium in which particles interact and convert among each other while keeping the total number of particles. Ie, in this case it will mean that dark matter particles annihilate to SM (\\(\\chi \\chi \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}\\)) and SM particles produce dark matter particles (\\(f\\bar{f} \\rightarrow \\chi \\chi\\)). Dark matter annihilation happens at the rate that depends on the square of dark matter number density (because we need 2 DM particles) and the thermally average annihilation cross-section, so we can add this term in the equation above \\(n^2_\\chi \\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle\\). On the contrary, the convertion of SM particles to DM can be is produced as a rate of \\(-n^2_{SM} \\langle \\sigma_{A,inv} v_\\chi \\rangle\\). At equilibrium, both processes must compensate so we can write:\n\\[n^2_{\\chi, eq} \\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle = n^2_{SM} \\langle \\sigma_{A,inv} v_\\chi \\rangle\\]\nwhich leads us to the Boltzman equation written as:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} n_\\chi}{\\mathrm{d}t} = - 3 H n_\\chi  - \\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle (n^2_\\chi - n^2_{\\chi, eq})\\]\n\n\nThermal freeze-out and the WIMP “miracle”\nFrom the boltzman equation is easy to see what would happen in an Universe with no expansion, \\(H = 0\\). It is clear that if \\(n^2_\\chi &gt; n^2_{\\chi,eq}\\) annihilation will dominate until the number of \\(\\chi\\) particles drops to its equilibrium value. If the universe is expanding, but the expansion is slow, we still can ignore the term \\(-3Hn_\\chi\\) but temperature will change and it will change the number density in equilibrium. For cold dark matter, like not relativistic wimps with mass \\(M_\\chi \\gg T\\), this follow the equilibrium density function from the Boltzmann relation:\n\\[n_{\\chi, eq}(T)  = \\left(\\frac{M_\\chi T}{2\\pi}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp \\left(\\frac{-M_\\chi}{T}\\right)\\]\nIn other words, the number density of dark matter drops as the tempeture goes down and Universe expands. (Hot dark matter on the other hand will be \\(n^{HDM}_\\chi(T) \\sim T^3\\)) What happens is that annihilation processes like \\(\\chi \\chi \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}\\) happen easily, but because \\(\\chi\\) is heavy, inverse annihilation processes like \\(f\\bar{f} \\rightarrow \\chi\\chi\\) happen only very rarely (with photons on the tail of the momentum distribution).\nAt some point the expansion of the Universe becomes important and we no longer can ignore the term \\(-3Hn_\\chi\\). As \\(n_\\chi\\) becomes smaller, the expansion rate becomes more important that the annihilation term that depends on \\(n^2_\\chi\\). Dark matter particles are separated away from each other and they cannot annihilate. This is the freeze-out of dark matter. At that moment the number density of dark matter becomes estable in a solution called the freeze-out abundance.\nIn a radiation dominated Universe the expansion of the Universe is given by:\n\\[H(T) \\propto \\frac{T^2}{M_{Pl}}\\]\nwhere \\(M_{PL}\\) is the plank mass. So according to the Boltzman equation, in an expanding Universe the moment of the freeze-out is given by the condition:\n\\[n_\\chi(T_{fo}) \\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle =  3H(T_{fo})\\]\nwhere we can assume that \\(n_\\chi = n_{\\chi,eq}\\). After the freeze-out, the number density changes scales with \\(a(t)^{-3}\\) but also \\(T\\) scales with \\(a(t)^{-1}\\) so the number density of dark matter particles today can be written as:\n\\[n_\\chi(T_0) \\sim n_\\chi(T_{fo})\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_{fo}}\\right)^3 \\sim \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_{fo}}\\right)^3 \\times \\frac{T_{fo}^2/M_{Pl}}{\\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle}\\]\nThe mass density is then, \\(\\rho_\\chi = M_\\chi n_\\chi\\) and dividing by the critical energy gives:\n\\[\\Omega_\\chi = \\frac{\\rho_\\chi}{\\rho_c} \\sim \\frac{10^{-25}}{\\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle} \\mathrm{cm}^3\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\nFinding the right relic density of dark matter is the same as finding the right value of \\(\\langle \\sigma_{A} v_\\chi \\rangle\\). As it happens this values turns out to be in the same range expected for the weak interactions. This is called the WIMP miracle…\n\n\nDirect detection\nThe differential rate per unit detector mass is given by:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d} E_R} = \\frac{n_\\chi}{m_N} \\Biggl\\langle v \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}E_R}\\Biggr\\rangle\\]\nAs can be seen the rate depends on the dark matter density since \\(n_\\chi = \\rho_\\chi/m_\\chi\\), the velocity of DM, \\(v\\) and their differential cross-section.\nThe recoil energy can be measured by this three different techniques:\n\nPhonon/Thermal: vibration (seen as rise in T) in a crystal due to the recoiled of the nucleus impacted by the WIMP.\nIonization: an electron is pushed away from its nucleus. A magnetic field drives the electron to a charge detector\nScintillation: an electron absorbs energy in the interaction. A short time after, it de-excites and emits a photon.\n\n\n\nIndirect detection\nThe flux of particles observed in a indirect detector using \\(\\gamma\\)-rays or neutrinos can be deducted from this formula:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_x}{\\mathrm{d}E_x} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\langle \\sigma_A v \\rangle}{2m_\\chi^2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} N_x}{\\mathrm{d}E_x} \\int_0^{\\Delta \\Omega} \\mathrm{d} \\Omega \\int_{l.o.s} \\rho_\\chi^2(r(s,\\Psi, \\theta)) \\mathrm{d} s\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) = \\(\\gamma\\)-rays, \\(\\nu\\). The J-Factor is the integral of the density square (we need two dark matter particles to annihilate) along the line of sight. There are many halo models in the market. Simulations favor that the DM collapse give “cuspy” profiles, i.e. more peaked (good for enhancing the signal). Observations of rotation curves of galaxies favor “cored” profiles, i.e. constant density cores Substructure not well resolved below \\(\\sim 10^5 M_\\odot\\), which may have an important effect due to the \\(\\rho^2\\) dependency of signal Effect of baryons is still unclear:\n\nsteepening through adiabatic contraction\nflattening through star bursts\n\n\n\nTargets for indirect detection\nDwarf Galaxies: * clean (low star formation) * largest mass-to-light ratio * boost factors irrelevant * about 25 known dwarf satellites of MW * best limits for \\(\\langle \\sigma_A v \\rangle\\): already at natural scale for small masses (~10 GeV) with Fermi-LAT\nGalaxy Cluster: * Largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe * Dark matter dominated * Substructure is quite uncertain * Boost factors could be very large, making them competitive with dwarf galaxies in the most optimistic cases * Astrophysical background could be important (AGNs, CR interacting with hadronic material…)\nIsotropic emission: * Spectrum: power law from 200 MeV to 100 GeV with γ=2.4) * Mainly due to extragalactic unresolved sources: starburst and normal galaxies, galaxy clusters, shocks by the assembly or large scale structures * Detection of DM difficult, but upper bounds can be set assuming contributions from these populations, able to discard the PAMELA excess DM interpretation\nGalactic Center:\n\nBrightest source of DM by two orders of magnitude\nLarge astrophysical background\nFor GeV searches also interaction of CRs with molecular material in the inner Galaxy\nSearches focused slightly off the most inner GC\nMore effect of the DM profile, since it is closer\n\nSun and Earth * Only visibles in neutrinos. * Low or intexistant background * Less effects on the Halo model profiles * Dark Matter is accumulated as an effect of the capturing of dark matter, these searches can prove the \\(\\sigma_{\\chi N}\\)\nAbsorption in the Sun\nThe mean free path of neutrinos in the Sun is given by:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{A_H}{N_A\\rho \\sigma} = \\frac{ 1\\; \\mathrm{mol}}{6.023 \\times 10^{23}\\; \\mathrm{mol/gr} 1.6 \\times 10^5\\; \\mathrm{gr/cm}^3 0.686\\times 10^{-38}\\; \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{GeV} 5000 \\;\\mathrm{GeV}} = 3.0 \\times 10^5 \\mathrm{\\; cm} \\ll 7 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{cm}  = R_\\odot\\]\n\n\nCapturing of DM in local celestial bodies\nDark Matter in the Sun or Earth is accumulated by scattering processes of DM followed by gravitational capture of DM. It is not the relic density that we can find for instance at the Center of the Galaxy or other astrophysical places like Dwarf Galaxies, etc. Let’s assume \\(N\\) to be the number of DM particles in a celestial body. The equation that govern the evolution of this density can be described as:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_c - C_A N^2 - C_E N\\]\nThe various elements of this equation are:\n\n\\(C_E\\) is the “evaporation” of dark matter, it is the escape of DM due to their thermal velociy being equivalent to the escape velocity of the celestial body. The Sun’s escape velocity is \\(v_{esc} \\simeq 1156\\) km/s. Assuming DM particles sink into the core of the Sun and gain the thermal velocity the typical velocity is:\n\n\\[v_\\chi  \\simeq c \\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{keV}}{m_\\chi}\\right)^{1/2} \\geq  v_{esc}^{\\odot} \\rightarrow m_\\chi \\leq 0.1 \\mathrm{GeV}\\]\nonly for very low masses the evaporation term is important.\n\n\\(C_A\\) is the annihilation term which depends on the factor \\(\\langle \\sigma_A v \\rangle\\) and an effective volume.\n\\(C_c\\) is the capture term and it depends on the DM-nucleon cross-sections \\(\\sigma_{\\chi-N}\\). For capture in the Earth the main contribution comes from the spin-independent cross-section which is quadratically proportional to \\(A^2\\) of the elements in Earth. It is also proportional to the DM flux, ie (for the Sun): \\[ C_c \\sim \\frac{\\rho_\\chi}{m_\\chi}v_\\chi \\left(\\frac{M_\\odot}{m_N}\\right)\\sigma_{\\chi-N}\\]\n\nBy solving the equation above (ignoring the evaporation term) we can express the total annihilation rate \\(\\Gamma_A\\) is expressed as:\n\\[\\Gamma_A = \\frac{1}{2}C_A N^2 = \\frac{C_c}{2}\\left[\\tanh(\\sqrt{C_c C_A} t)\\right]^2\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is the lifetime of the celestial body. It is clear from this equation that equilibrium is reached when:\n\\[t_{eq} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C_c C_A}}\\]\nFor the Earth, this equilibrium time is of the order of \\(10^{11}\\) years if the spin-independent WIMP-proton cross-section is $^{SI}_{- p} 10^{-43} \\(cm\\)^{2}$ which is longer than the age of the solar system \\(t_{Earth} \\sim 4.5\\) Gyr. In the Sun however, most models predict \\(t_{eq} \\ll t_\\odot\\) and therefore we can assume that equilibrium is reached in the Sun.",
