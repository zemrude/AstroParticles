    "text": "3.1.1 Introduction\nIn this lesson we will the different components of a cosmic air shower when cosmic rays interact with Earth’s atmosphere. As seen in the figure below, we have 3 main components, the electromagnetic component, the hadronic component and muons and neutrinos which can be seen as the muonic component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 The Atmosphere\nBefore studying the interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere we need to setup a model that will describe our atmosphere. To study the cosmic rays interactions in the atmosphere it is useful to define a parameter that we will call the vertical atmospheric depth (sometimes also called column density) defined as the integral in altitude of the atmospheric density \\(\\rho\\) above the observation level \\(h\\):\n\\[X(h) =\\int_h^{\\infty} \\rho(h^\\prime)\\mathrm{ d}h^\\prime\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 The isothermal model of the Atmosphere\nIn an isothermal hydrostatic atmosphere a particular layer of gas at some altitude is static. That means that the downward (towards the planet) force of its weight, plus the downward force exerted by pressure in the layer above it, and the upward force exerted by pressure in the layer below, all sum to zero. Assuming a segment of area \\(A\\) and heigth \\(\\mathrm{ d}h\\) we can write this equilibrium of forces as:\n\\[P\\cdot A - (P + \\mathrm{ d}P)\\cdot A - (\\rho A \\mathrm{ d}h)g_0  =0\\]\n\\[\\mathrm{ d}P = -g_0\\rho(h) \\mathrm{ d}h\\]\nUsing the ideal gas law:\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\rho R T}{M}\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the ideal gas constant, \\(T\\) is temperature, \\(M\\) is average molecular weight, and \\(g_0\\) is the gravitational acceleration at the planet’s surface. We get\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}P}{P} = -\\frac{g_0 M}{R T} \\mathrm{ d} h\\]\nassuming a constant and isothermal gas (const \\(T\\)) we can integrate a pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height as:\n\\[P = P_0 e^{-\\frac{g_0 M}{R T} h} \\]\nwhere the we can define the scale height as:\n\\[ h_0 = \\frac{R T}{M g_0} \\]\nSince the temperature is assumed to be constant it follows that \\(\\rho\\) also changes exponentially as \\(\\rho = \\rho_0 e^{-h/h_0}\\) and therefore the column density can be written as:\n\\[X = X_0 \\mathrm{ e}^{-h/h_0}\\]\nwhere \\(X_0\\) is 1030 g/cm\\(^{2}\\) is the atmospheric depth at sea level, h = 0. In particular for the isothermal model we have that the relation between atmospheric depth (aka column density) and density is:\n\\[ \\rho(X) = \\frac{X}{h_0} \\]\n\n3.1.2.1.1 The Scale Height\nUsing typical values (\\(T = 273\\) K and \\(M = 29\\) g/mol) we get that \\(h_0 \\sim 8\\) km which coincidentally is the approximate height of Mt. Everest.\nIn reality the temperature changes and hence the scale height decreases with increasing altitude until the tropopause.\nThis equations are valid for vertical particles, for zenith angles &lt; 60\\(^\\circ\\) (for which we can ignore the Earth’s curvature) the formula is scaled with \\(1/\\cos{\\theta}\\) giving the slant depth\n\\[X_{slant-depth} = \\frac{X}{\\cos \\theta} \\]\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Energy Losses in the Atmosphere\nCharge particles when entering in the atmosphere will suffer different process of energy losses. We are going to review some of them\n\n3.1.3.1 Ionization Losses\nThe ionization energy loss of high energy charged particles with colission with atomic electrons is given by the Bethe-Block formula:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} E}{\\mathrm{ d} x}\\right)_{ion}= -\\left(\\frac{4\\pi N_0z^2e^4}{mv^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)\\left\\{\\log\\left[\\frac{2mv^2\\gamma^2}{I}\\right]-\\beta^2\\right\\}\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron, \\(v\\) and \\(ze\\) are the velocity and charge of the incoming particle, \\(N_0\\) is the Avogadro’s number, \\(Z\\) and \\(A\\) are the atomic and mass numbers of the atmos in the medium and \\(x\\) the path travelled, and \\(I\\) is the ionization potential of the medium is approximatively 10 Z eV.\n\nSince \\(Z/A \\sim \\frac{1}{2}\\) in most materials it depends little on the medium.\nIt varies as \\(1/v^2\\) at low speed and independent of the incident particle mass.\nIt reaches a minimum at about \\(3Mc^2\\) and it increases logarithmically until it reaches a plateu value.\n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Radiation Losses\nIn addition to ionization losses, charge particles also undergo bremsstrahlung or braking radiation when travelling through a material given by:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ d} E}{\\mathrm{ d} x}\\right)_{rad} = -\\frac{E}{X_0}\\] where for electrons the radiation length is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{X_0} = 4 \\alpha\\left(\\frac{Z}{A}\\right)(Z + 1)^2r_e^2N_0\\log\\left(\\frac{183}{Z^{1/3}}\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(r_e = e^2/4\\pi m_e c^2\\) is the classical electron radius and \\(\\alpha = \\frac{1}{137}\\) is the fine structure constant.\n\nBremsstrahlung is proportional to \\(\\frac{1}{X_0} \\propto r^2_{e} \\propto 1/m_e^2\\). The radiation length of a muon will be \\((m_\\mu/m_e)^2\\) times that for an electron.\nBremsstrahlung is proportional to the energy.\n\nThe critical energy is the energy at \\((\\mathrm{ d}E/\\mathrm{ d}x)_{ion} = (\\mathrm{ d}E/\\mathrm{ d}x)_{rad}\\). Above this energy the radiation process dominates, below the ionization. For electrons this is roughly \\(\\epsilon_c \\sim 600/Z\\) MeV, and for the atmosphere this is \\(\\epsilon_e \\sim 85\\) MeV.\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Cherenkov Radiation\nWhen relativistic particles traverse a medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium it can induce Cherenkov radiation.\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nCherenkov light is emitted in the UV and blue region in a narrow cone with angle:\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{ct/n}{\\beta c t} = \\frac{1}{\\beta n}\\]\nso the threshold for production is \\(\\beta &gt; \\frac{1}{n}\\). Most of the components in the air shower will produced abundant Cherenkov light.\nWe will see more on Cherenkov radiation on the next lesson about \\(\\gamma\\)-ray astronomy.\n\n\n3.1.3.4 Pair production\nIf a photon from bremsstrahlung has enougth energy \\(E_\\gamma &gt; 2 m_e\\) it can produced a pair of electron positron. The cross-section rises quickly at the threshod of \\(2 m_e\\) but in the high energy part it can be approximated to:\n\\[\\sigma = \\frac{7}{9} r_0^2 Z (Z+ 1)\\log \\left(\\frac{183}{3\\sqrt{Z}}\\right)\\]\nThe pair production cannot occure in vacum, a photon desintegrated to the pair \\(e^-e^+\\) will have a null momentum in the CoM system, therefore a nucleus has to be present to absorb the momemtum. As can be seen the radiation length \\(X_0\\) is very similar to the one from radiation losses. In fact we can write:\n\\[\\frac{1}{X_{pair}} = \\frac{7}{9}\\frac{1}{X_0}\\]\nWhich means that the radiation lengths for braking radiation and pair production are comparable.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Electromagnetic Shower\nWhen photons from radiation losses of electrons, have enough energy to produce pairs of positrons electrons, these hey also can produce photons which, in turn, can also produces pairs, etc, etc. This is called an electromagnetic shower.\n\n3.1.4.1 The Heitler Toy-Model\nThe Heitler toy model explains very well the development of an electromagnetic shower. As we saw, in the ultrarelativistic limit the radiation lenghs for pair production and bremsstrahung are comparable. We can defined a distance \\(d_{split} = X_0 \\log2\\) where an electron will looses, on average, half of its energy.\nAn electron with inital energy \\(E_0\\) in a medium will generate a photon in a \\(d_{split}\\) length of energy \\(E_0/2\\), in the next radiation length the photon can convert into \\(e^+e^-\\) each with energies \\(E_0/4\\). After \\(t\\) steps the electrons, positrons will have energies of \\(E(t)=E_0/2^t\\). This continues until the electrons, positrons fall below the critical energy of electrons, \\(\\epsilon_e\\), and ionization dominates. The process is illustrated in the figure below, where each step \\(n\\) corresponds to one \\(d_{split}\\) length.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heitler model has the following properties:\n\nThe shower has maximum at:\n\n\\[t_{max} = \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)}{\\log2}\\]\n\nThe maximum number of particles is:\n\n\\[N_{max} = 2^{t_{max}} = \\frac{E_0}{\\epsilon_e}\\]\n\nThe shower maximum will be at a depth \\(X_{max}\\):\n\n\\[X_{max}=d_{split} \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)}{\\log2} = X_0 \\log(E_0/\\epsilon_e)\\]\nFor air \\(\\epsilon_e = 85\\) MeV and the radiation length \\(X_0 = 36.7 \\mathrm{ g/cm}^2\\). Actual showers also spread laterally mostly due to Coulomb scattering. The lateral spread is a few times the so-called Moliere unit equal to \\(21/\\epsilon_e\\) (MeV).\nThe \\(X_{max}\\) prediction of the Heitler model is in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. However, the electron to photon ratio of 2 is not in agreement given that the model predicts only one photon emitted by bremsstrahlung. Simulations show a ratio of 1/6 since in reality several photons are emitted and electrons lose energy much faster than photons do.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Hadronic Showers\nBefore modeling the baryon-induced showers or hadronic showers, we need to estimate the nuclean mean free path in the atmosphere. We can write the standard mean free path for \\(\\sigma^{air}_N\\) nucleon-air cross section as:\n\\[l_N = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma_N^{air}}\\]\nwhere as we saw in the introduction \\(n\\) is the number density of targets, in our case air nuclei. This number density can be expresed as $n = N_T/V $ where \\(N_T\\)is the total number of air nuclei in volume \\(V\\).\nThe density mean free path, is defined as \\(\\lambda_N = \\rho_{air} l_N\\), where \\(\\rho_{air} = n \\cdot m_{air}\\) where \\(m_{air}\\) is the mass of air nuclei, that can be written as \\(m_{air} \\sim A m_p\\). Puttin everything together we have that:\n\\[\\lambda^{air}_N = \\rho_{air} l_N = n A m_p\\frac{1}{n\\sigma_N^{air}} = \\frac{A m_{p}}{\\sigma_N^{air}}\\]\nFor air \\(A\\) is average mean the mass number of air nuclei components (mainly nitrogen, oxygen) and we can assume it to be \\(A \\sim 14.5\\) and \\(\\sigma_N^{air} \\approx\\) 300 mb, which corresponds to \\(\\lambda_N^{air} \\approx 80\\)g/cm\\(^{2}\\).\nNote that this definition of the density mean free path is independent of the mass density of the medium, so if the density changes with altitude, like in the case of our atmosphere, the density mean free path is the same.\n\n3.1.5.1 The Heitler-Matthew Model\nIn the Heitler model can be adapted also for hadronic showers. This is what Matthew did. We can imagine a proton initiating the cascade instead of a photon/electron, in this case a hadronic air shower will develope:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can assume that the first interaction is defined by the proton mean free path \\(\\lambda^{air}_N\\). Defining the first interaction point where the proton will lose (on average) half of its energy this first interaction length is given as \\(\\lambda^{air}_{N} \\log 2\\) where for protons \\(\\lambda^{air}_N \\approx 80\\)g/cm. The following general interaction is expected:\n\\[ p + p/n \\rightarrow p + n/p + \\pi^0 + \\pi^{\\pm} + K^0 + K^{\\pm} + .. \\]\nWe will focus only on pion production (same argument can be done for kaons). After the first interaction we can use the simplified assumption that the hadronic interaction produces only \\(3N_\\pi\\) pions. Of those $ 2 N_$ will be charged pions and \\(N_\\pi\\) will be \\(\\pi^0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also assume the energy is equally distributed among them, so \\(2/3E_0\\) will go to charge pions and \\(1/3E_0\\) will go to the neutral pions. The \\(\\pi^0\\) has a very short decay time, so it will decay and produce an electromagnetic shower. Charge pions will continue generating hadronic shower in each \\(d_{split} = \\lambda_{\\pi}^{air} \\log 2\\) with the mean free path of pions \\(\\lambda_\\pi^{air} \\sim 120\\)g/cm\\(^2\\) until they reach the critical energy where pions decay is more probable than interactions \\(\\epsilon_\\pi\\). On each step we assume that energy is equally divided among the \\(3 N_\\pi\\) pions. Thefore at each step \\(t\\) the energy of the pions is:\n\\[E_\\pi = \\frac{E_0}{(3N_\\pi)^t} \\]\nThe number of radiation lengths \\(t\\) to reach the critical energy ie \\(E_\\pi = \\epsilon_\\pi\\), and is given (as in the case of EM showers):\n\\[t_{max} = \\frac{\\log(E_0/\\epsilon_\\pi)}{\\log(3N_\\pi)}\\]\nAssuming that after that energy all charged pions (ie \\(2N_\\pi\\)) decay to muons, the number of muons is given by:\n\\[N_\\mu =(2N_\\pi)^{t_{max}}\\]\nintroducing \\(\\beta = \\log(2N_\\pi)/\\log(3N_\\pi)\\) we have:\n\\[N_\\mu =(E_0/\\epsilon_\\pi)^\\beta \\]\nThis is also called the multiplicity and corresponds to the muon bundles as we will see later. For pions between 1 GeV and 10 TeV an appropiate number is \\(N_\\pi = 5\\) and in that case \\(\\beta = 0.85\\). Therefore the number of muons doesn’t grow linearly with the intial energy but a slower rate.\nThe definition of \\(X_{max}\\) is somehow less clear than in an EM shower. Hadronic showers are still dominated by electromagnetic processes, so we can assume that \\(X_{max}\\) depends dominantly on the first generation of \\(\\pi^0\\) EM subshowers. For proton primaries, the first interaction will be given by the nucleon mean free path where in this first interaction the proton splits in \\(3N_\\pi\\) particles, so \\(pi^0\\) with initial energy \\(E_0/3N_\\pi\\) will initiate an EM shower. The depth of maximum is then obtained as the sum of the first proton interaction length and the shower maximum of the first EM sub-shower:\n\\[X_{max} = \\lambda^{air}_N \\log2 + X_0 \\log\\left(\\frac{E_0}{3N_\\pi\\epsilon_e}\\right) \\]\nwhere again \\(\\epsilon_e\\) is the critical energy of electrons. The expected values of this formula are low when compared to detailed simulations because it neglects the contributions of the next one or two generation of \\(\\pi^0\\) production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperposition model for heavy nuclei air showers\n\n\n\nWe can extend the discussion to heavy nuclei by adopting the Superposition model in which a nucleus of mass A and energy \\(E_0\\) essentially generates \\(A\\) subshowers of energy \\(E_0/A\\). In that case the muon multiplicity will be:\n\\[N_\\mu = A \\left(\\frac{E_0}{A\\epsilon_\\pi}\\right)^\\beta \\propto E_0^\\beta A^{1 - \\beta} \\]\ntherefore the muon multiplicity will depend on the CR composition. Likewise the shower maximum is given by:\n\\[X^{A}_{max}(E_0) = X_{max}^{p}(E_0) - X_0\\log{A}\\]\nie, for a given energy \\(E_0\\) the shower max depends on the mass of the CR primary and it is typicall smaller than for protons (ie reach the maximum sooner in the atmosphere). For composition studies therefore it is necessary to measure \\(X_{max}\\) and the energy of the shower, which can be estimated from fluorescence techniques.",

    "text": "3.2 Muons and Neutrinos\nThe plot below shows the particle flux surviving after a certain altitude.\n\n\n\nSource: Particle Data Group\n\n\nWe can extract different information from this plot:\n\nPrimaries dominate up to 9 km, secondaries (electrons, pions) roughly follow the primary shape. Muons and neutrinos are continously produced.\nVertical fluxes for \\(E &gt; 1\\) GeV. Points show the \\(\\mu^-\\) measurements. Muons and neutrinos are produced in decays of mesons which are themselves produced by interactions of CR particles with air nuclei.\nThey are the dominant flux at sea level and the only ones that can penetrate deep underground.\n\nElectrons and nucleons fluxes above 1 GeV/\\(c\\) are about 0.2 and 2 m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) sr\\(^{-1}\\) at sea level. Nucleons are the degraded remnants of the primary cosmic radiation. At sea level about 1/3 are neutrons.\n\n3.2.1 Muons and Neutrinos Productions\nThe most important channels for muon and neutrino production are:\n\nTwo body decays \\[\\pi^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\mu^{\\pm} + \\nu_{\\mu}({ \\bar \\nu_\\mu}) \\rm{\\;\\; (\\sim 100\\%)}\\] \\[K^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\mu^{\\pm} + \\nu_{\\mu}({\\bar \\nu_\\mu}) \\rm{\\;\\; (\\sim 63.5\\%)}\\]\nThree body decay \\[K_L \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\pm} e^{\\pm}\\nu_e({\\bar \\nu_e}) \\rm{\\;\\; (\\sim 38.7\\%)}\\]\n\nAt lower energies, the muon decay is also important:\n\\[ \\mu^{\\pm} \\rightarrow e^{\\pm} + \\nu_{e}({\\bar \\nu_e}) + {\\bar \\nu_{\\mu}}(\\nu_\\mu)\\]\nFor each of the 2-body decay channels, assuming the muon always decay the neutrino flavor ratio is:\n\\[\\bf{ \\nu_\\mu : \\nu_e = 2:1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean free path for mesons, \\(\\pi\\), \\(K\\)\n\n\n\nCharged pions and Kaons can interact or decay. Both processes have a mean free path and one or the other will dominate depending on which mean free path is larger.\nThe decay mean free path of pions is given by \\(l^d_\\pi =\\gamma  c \\tau_\\pi\\) where \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor of the pion. Multiplying for density we have the density decay mean free path as:\n\\[\\lambda^d_\\pi = \\rho(X) \\gamma  c \\tau_\\pi\\]\nHowever the atmosphere density depends on the atmospheric depth as \\(\\rho(X) = X/h_0\\). In units of slant depth, \\(X_{sd} = X/\\cos\\theta\\) and expanding \\(\\gamma = E / m_\\pi c^2\\) we can rewrite the density decay free path as:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\lambda^d_\\pi(E)} = \\frac{m_\\pi c^2 h_0}{E c \\tau_\\pi X_{sd} \\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\epsilon_\\pi}{E X_{sd} \\cos\\theta}\\]\nwhere \\(E\\), \\(m_\\pi\\), \\(\\tau_\\pi\\) are the pion energy, mass and lifetime and we defined:\n\\[\\epsilon_\\pi = \\frac{c\\tau_\\pi}{m_\\pi c^2 h_0}\\]\nas a critial energy. The crital energy is such that the decay time equals the vertical atmospheric depth \\(\\lambda^d_\\pi(\\epsilon_\\pi) = X_{sd} \\cos\\theta = X\\).\nThe interaction mean free path is the same as nucleon \\(\\lambda_\\pi = A m_\\pi/\\sigma_\\pi^{air}\\) which as we saw is indenpendent of \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical energy for mesons, \\(\\pi\\), \\(K\\)\n\n\n\nDecay or interaction dominates depending on whether \\(1/\\lambda^d_\\pi\\) or \\(1/\\lambda_\\pi\\) is larger. This in turns depends on the ratio between the energy \\(E\\) and the critical energy \\(\\epsilon_\\pi\\). For example, the value of the crital energy for pions is given by:\n\\[\\epsilon_\\pi = \\frac{c\\tau_\\pi}{m_\\pi c^2 h_0} \\approx 115 \\;\\mathrm{ GeV}\\]\nSo we can distinguish two regimes.\n\nFor \\(E \\gg \\epsilon_\\pi\\) decay length is much larger than the atmospheric depth, so interaction dominates.\nFor \\(E \\ll \\epsilon_\\pi\\) decay dominates is much shorter than the atmospheric depth, so the pion will likely decay before interacting.\n\nThe same formulas can be derived for Kaons.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Muon Fluxes\nThe muon energy spectrum at sea level is a direct consequence of the meson source spectrum. Unlike electrons, muons will decay before reaching the ground in the GeV energy range. The muon decay length is given by:\n\\[ d_\\mu = \\gamma \\tau_\\mu c\\]\nWhere \\(\\tau_\\mu\\) is the muon lifetime of the order of \\(2.2\\times 10^{-6}\\) s. So for a muon of 1 GeV we have:\n\nlifetime = 2.1969811e-6 # muon lifetime in seconds\nimport scipy.constants as cte\ncspeed = cte.c\nmuon_mass = cte.value(\"muon mass energy equivalent in MeV\") * 1e-3 # in GeV\n\nenergy = 1 # GeV\n\nprint(f\"d = {(energy/muon_mass)*lifetime*cspeed*1e-3:.2f} km\")\n\nd = 6.23 km\n\n\nCompared to the typical atmospheric altitude of \\(h \\sim 15\\) km it means that at those energies, muons will not reach the ground.\n\n3.2.2.1 Energy regimes of muon fluxes\nThree different regimes are distinguishable:\n\n\\(E_\\mu \\leq \\epsilon_\\mu\\), where \\(\\epsilon_\\mu \\sim 1\\) GeV. This critical energy is when interaction probability and decay probability start to be comparable. Even more the muon energy losses become important. As we saw energy losses via ionization is almost constant, for muons is about \\(\\sim 2\\) MeV/(g/cm\\(^{2}\\)) in air (and mostly independent on the material). However this is true only above energies of 1 GeV, below ionization losses increase drastically as can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_\\mu \\leq E_\\mu \\leq \\epsilon_{\\pi,K}\\), where \\(\\epsilon_\\pi = 115 {\\;\\rm GeV}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_K = 850 {\\;\\rm GeV}\\). In this range all mesons decay and muons spectrum follows the same of the parent spectrum of mesons and hence that of the primary CRs. The muon is almost independent of the zenith angle.\n\\(E_\\mu \\gg \\epsilon_{\\pi,K}\\), Mesons interaction length starts to be comparable to their decay length. This happens first for inclined showers and so the muon flux gets suppressed while it also starts to depend on the zenith angle (ie on the density of the atmosphere).\n\nAt even highers energies, above 1 TeV in air, muons will also start to loose energie via other radiative process (we will see that below when talking about muons underground).\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Analytical approximation\nAn approximate extrapolation formula valid when muon decay is negligible (\\(E_\\mu &gt; 100/\\cos\\theta\\) GeV) and the curvature of the Earth can be neglected (\\(\\theta &lt; 70^{\\circ}\\)) is given by the Gaisser parametrization:\n\\[\\frac{dN_\\mu}{dE_\\mu d\\Omega} = \\frac{0.14}\\mathrm{cm^2\\;s\\;sr\\;GeV}\n\\left(\\frac{E_\\mu}\\mathrm{GeV}\\right)^{-2.7}\\left[F_\\pi(E_\\mu, \\theta) +\nF_K(E_\\mu,\\theta)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(F_\\pi\\) and \\(F_K\\) represent the contributions from pions and kaons, respectively:\n\\[F_\\pi(E_\\mu, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1.1 E_\\mu \\cos\\theta}{115 \\;\\mathrm{GeV}}}\\]\n\\[F_K(E_\\mu, \\theta) = \\frac{0.054}{1+\\frac{1.1 E_\\mu \\cos\\theta}{850\\;\\mathrm{GeV}}}\\]\n\n3.2.2.2.1 Tutorial I: Plot the muon flux for two different angles\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef muons(cangle, E):\n    a = 1./(1.+ 1.1*E*cangle/115.)\n    b = 0.054/(1.+ 1.1*E*cangle/850.)\n    return 0.14 *E**-2.7 *(a + b)\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(4,3))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\nax.set_xscale(\"log\")\nax.set_yscale(\"log\")\nax.set_ylim(1e-5, 3e-1)\nax.set_ylabel(r\"$E_\\mu^{2.7} dN_\\mu/dE_\\mu [cm^{-2}s^{-1} (GeV)^{1.7}]$\")\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\mu(GeV)$\")\nax.grid()\nE = np.arange(1e0, 1e6, 10)\nax.plot(E, E**2.7*muons(np.cos(75*np.pi/180.),E), label=r\"$\\theta = 75^{\\circ}$\")\nax.plot(E, E**2.7*muons(np.cos(0*np.pi/180.),E), label=r\"$\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.3 Measured muon flux\nIn reality below 10 GeV muon decay and energy loss become important and the Gaisser parametrization overestimates the muon flux as can be seen in the plot below:\n\n\n\nSource: Particle Data Group\n\n\nAs can be seen from the measured muon flux has the following characteristics:\n\nMuons are the most numerous charged particles at sea level\nThe mean energy of muons at the ground is \\(\\sim\\) 4 GeV.\nThe integral intensity of vertical muons above 1 GeV/c at sea level is \\(\\approx 70 \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\\) or \\(\\approx 1 \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Muon Bundles\nSometimes muons also come in groups or bundles of parallel muons originated from the same primary CR. Muon bundles sometime look like a single high energy muon. The multiplicity (number of muons in the bundle) if can be measured is correlated with the mass of the orignal CR. The image belowe shows a muon-bundle event observed with the MACRO underground detector.\n\n\n3.2.3.1 Charge Ratio\nThe muon charge ratio reflects the excess of \\(\\pi^+\\) over \\(\\pi^-\\) and \\(K^+\\) over \\(K^-\\) and the fact that there are more protons than neutrons in the primary spectrum.\n\n\n\nSource: Allkofer et. al. Phys.

Rev. D19, 1368 (1979)\n\n\nThe increase with energy of the ratio is due to an increasing importance of kaons coming from the process $ p + N + K^+$.\nAssuming the following reactions for the production of \\(\\pi^+\\) and \\(\\pi^{-}\\):\n\\[ p + N \\rightarrow p^\\prime + N^\\prime  + k \\pi^+ + k \\pi^- + r\\pi^0 \\] \\[ p + N \\rightarrow n + N^\\prime  + (k + 1) \\pi^+ + k \\pi^- + r\\pi^0 \\]\nwhere \\(k\\) and \\(r\\) are the multiplicity of the particle species. Assuming same cross sections we obtain:\n\\[ R = \\frac{N(\\pi^+)}{N(\\pi^-)} = \\frac{2k+1}{2k} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2k} \\]\nfor low energies \\(k = 2\\) and \\(R \\sim 1.25\\)\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Neutrinos Fluxes\n\nNeutrinos are the most abundant CR product at sea level, yet they have only recently (compared to other particles) measured due to their extremely low cross-section.\nThe process giving neutrino fluxes are the same as for the muons (we saw already) plus the muon decay. Taking into account the decay of pions, kaons and muons gives to a flavor ratio of: \\(\\nu_\\mu : \\nu_e = 2:1\\) and \\(\\nu_e/{\\bar \\nu_e} \\sim \\mu^+/\\mu^-\\)\nAt few GeV (&gt; \\(\\epsilon_\\mu\\)) muons will not decay and \\(\\nu_e\\) will be supressed as the main source of \\(\\nu_e\\) is the muon decay.\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom daemonflux import Flux\nfl = Flux(location='generic', use_calibration=True, debug=1)\negrid = np.logspace(0,5)\n\n# Start with a square Figure.\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\ngs = fig.add_gridspec(2, 1, \n                      left=0.1, right=0.9, bottom=0.1, top=0.9,\n                      height_ratios = (4, 1), wspace=0.05, hspace=0.12)\n# Create the Axes.\nax_1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0])\nax_2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1], sharex=ax)\n\nax_1.plot(egrid, fl.flux(egrid, \"60\", \"numuflux\")+fl.flux(egrid, \"60\", \"antinumu\"), label=r\"$\\nu_{\\mu}$ at $\\theta = 60^\\circ$\")\nax_1.plot(egrid, fl.flux(egrid, \"60\", \"nueflux\"), label=r\"$\\nu_{e}$ at $\\theta = 60^\\circ$\")\nax_1.legend()\nax_1.loglog()\nax_1.grid()\nax_2.plot(egrid, fl.flux(egrid, \"60\", \"numuflux\")/fl.flux(egrid, \"60\", \"nueflux\"), label=r\"\\nu_{\\mu}\", lw=2, color=\"black\")\nax_2.grid()\nax_2.set_xscale(\"log\")\nax_2.set_ylim(0, 30)\nax_2.set_xlim(1, 1e5)\nax_1.set_xlim(1, 1e5)\nax_2.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\nu$/GeV\")\nax_1.set_ylabel(r\"$(E_\\nu/\\mathrm{ GeV})^3 \\Phi_\\nu (\\mathrm{ GeV}\\mathrm{ \\;cm}^2\\mathrm{ s\\; sr})^{-1}$\")\nax_2.set_ylabel(r\"$\\Phi_{\\nu_\\mu} / \\Phi_{\\nu_e}$\")\n\n\nText(0, 0.5, '$\\\\Phi_{\\\\nu_\\\\mu} / \\\\Phi_{\\\\nu_e}$')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn astrophysical sources the ration 2:1 persists. Why pions don’t decay in to electrons?\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Fluxes and Kinematics\nAs mentioned neutrinos and muons are strongly correlated. However due the two-body kinematics, the energy spectra of the \\(\\nu\\)’s and \\(\\mu\\)’s from mesons decay are different. For example, the energy of the muon in CoM is given by:\n\\[E_\\mu^{*} = (m_\\pi^2 + m_\\mu^2)/2m_\\pi = 109.8\\;\\mathrm{MeV}\\]\nand for the neutrino:\n\\[E_\\nu^{*} = (m_\\pi^2 - m_\\mu^2)/2m_\\pi = 29.8\\;\\mathrm{MeV}\\]\nIn the laboratory system, the energies are boosted by the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma= E_\\pi /m_\\pi\\), but as can be seen muon carry a much larger fraction of energy than neutrinos. For energies about 1 TeV $ &lt; E_&lt; 10^3$ TeV, the angle averaged atmospheric \\(\\nu_\\mu + {\\bar \\nu_\\mu}\\) can be approximated by a power law spectrum:\n\\[\\frac\\mathrm{{d}N_{\\nu_\\mu + {\\bar \\nu_\\mu}}}\\mathrm{{d}E_\\nu} = 7.8 \\times 10^{-11}\\left(\\frac{E_\\nu}{1\\;\\mathrm{TeV}}\\right)^{-3.6} \\mathrm{cm^2\\;s^{-1}\\;sr^{-1}\\;GeV^{-1}}\\]\n\n3.2.5.1 Fluxes as Function of Zenith\nAnother difference with respect to the muon fluxes is their dependency with respect to the zenith angle. Since atmospheric muons are not absorved by the Earth, their spectrum spans to the whole sky. The following plot shows the calculated neutrino flux at 1,300 m depth with energies \\(E_\\nu = 10\\) GeV.\n\n\n\nSource: arXiv:1210.5154\n\n\nThe peak at the horizon in the atmospheric neutrino flux is due to the so-called secant theta effect. This effect occurs because pions and kaons that are produced nearly skimming the Earth have more flight time in less dense atmosphere, so they have more chance to decay than interact.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Prompt Fluxes\nApart from kaons and pions, charmed messons will also be produced in the atmosphere. Charm particles have lifetimes so short (\\(10^{-12}\\)s) they almost alway decay before interacting. Muons and neutrinos from charm decay are called prompt muons/neutrinos. They have the following peculiarities:\n\nThe energy spectrum follows the one of the primary cosmic rays ie that of \\(\\sim E^{-2.7}\\).\nSince there is no competition between decay and interaction of the charm particle, the prompt flux is fully isotropic.\nSince neutrinos are produced in 3-body decays they produced the same amount of \\(\\nu_\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu_e\\).\n\nIt is important to note that the prompt fluxes have not been observed yet.",

    "text": "3.3 Particles Underground\n\n3.3.1 Muon Interactions\nWhen muon reaches the ground the will experience the following interactions when travelling through matter with a higher density than air. The will losse energy mostly through the following processes:\n\nIonization. The continuous energy loss of muons passing through a medium as it ionize the material along the path. We saw however that ionization is mostly independent of the material, as most of them have values of \\(Z/A \\sim 0.5\\).\n\n\n\nBremsstrahlung. Also called braking radiation. In the electric field of a nucleus or atomic electrons, muons can radiate high energy photons. If the photon has energy enough it can initiate an electromagnetic shower.\n\n\n\nPair production. A muon can radiate a virtual photon which, again in the electric field of a nucleus, can convert into a real \\(e^+e^-\\) pair. As in the case of bremsstrahlung, the pair production will initate an electromagnetic shower.\n\n\n\nPhotonuclear interactions. A muon can radiate a virtual photon which directly interacts with a nucleus in the muon propagation medium. The interaction is either electromagnetic or following the fluctuation of the photon into a quark-antiquark pair (i.e. a virtual vector meson). This interaction will generate an hadronic shower.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Muon Energy losses\nThe energy losses due to ionization are continuous while in radiation processes the energy is lost in bursts along the muon path. When a muon is travelling through a dielectric medium like ice or water, it will emit cherenkov photons as wells, but due to the stochastics energy losses electromagnetic and hadronic showers are generated along the muon track. The following figure illustrates this process:\n\nIt is worth noting that photonuclear interactions are subdominant when compared to bremsstrahlung and pair-production, so most of the showers will be electromagnetic showers. The equation that describes the energy loss for muons at high energy can be simplified to:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{ d}E_\\mu}{\\mathrm{ d}X} = -\\alpha -\\beta E_\\mu\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the thickness of the material (in \\(\\mathrm{ g/cm}^2\\)), \\(\\alpha\\) is the energy loss due to ionization and \\(\\beta = \\beta_{br} + \\beta_{pair} + \\beta_{ph}\\) are the three discrete energy loss processes: bremsstrahlung, electron-positron production and electromagnetic interaction with the nuclei. Thickness is also given sometimes in units of meters water equivalent (1 m.w.e. = \\(10^2 \\mathrm{\\; g/cm^2}\\)). Due to the energy dependency of the radiative processes, higher energy muons will have more stochastic energy losses than lower energy muons.\nThe critical energy is when both losses are equal, ie \\(\\epsilon_\\mu = \\alpha/\\beta\\). Typical values are \\(\\alpha \\simeq 2 \\mathrm{ \\;MeV\\;g}^{-1} \\mathrm{ \\;cm}^2\\) and \\(\\beta \\simeq 4 \\times 10^{-6} \\;\\mathrm{ g^{-1}\\;cm^2}\\), so \\(\\epsilon_\\mu \\approx 500\\) GeV.\nThe following plots showd simulated muons bundles in IceCube. The stochastic energy losses are particular clear in the right figure.\n\n \n\n\n\n3.3.3 Muon Range\nBy solving the energy loss equation we can estimate the range \\(R\\) for a muon \\(E_\\mu\\), ie the underground depth this muon will reach until its energy is 0 (in reality the muon when reaching low energies will decay) (see Exercises 2):\n\\[ R(E_\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\log\\left( 1 + \\frac{E_\\mu}{\\epsilon_\\mu}\\right)\\]\nAssuming the muon spectrum at sea level can be approximated to a power law \\(I_\\mu(&gt;E_\\mu) = AE_\\mu^{-\\gamma}\\) and using the relationship between range and energy we can write the depth-intensity relation (DIR):\n\\[I_\\mu(&gt;E_\\mu, R) = A\\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}(e^{\\beta R} - 1)\\right]^{-\\gamma}\\]\nThe plot below shows the depth-intensity muons for vertical directions. The grey-area are neutrino-induced muons (horizontal, up-wards)\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Neutrino Interactions\n\n3.3.4.1 Weak interaction\nNeutrinos feel only the weak force thus interactions with matter mediated by W and Z bosons with cross-sections typical of weak processes. Feynman diagrams factor along two lines:\n\nNeutral current (NC) interactions - exchange of Z\nCharged current (CC) interaction - exchange of W\\(^{\\pm}\\)\n\n\nNeutrinos will scatter from electrons as well as nuclear matter.\n\nFor energies \\(E_\\nu &lt; 1\\) GeV neutrinos interact with hadronds via elastic or quasielastic scattering.\nFor energies \\(E_\\nu \\gg 1\\) GeV neutrinos do not scatter on hadronds as a compound of quarks, they start to see and interact directly the quarks, Deep Inelastic Scattering.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Neutrino cross-sections at GeV energies\nThe anti-neutrino cross-section at GeV energies is a factor ~2 lower (naively should be 3, but the factor 2 comes from the structure function of the nucleus) than the neutrino cross-section due to the helicity.\n\nAt \\(E_\\nu \\gg 1\\) GeV the total DIS cross-section (ie, assuming CC and NC together) can be approximated to:\n\\[\\sigma_{\\nu p} \\simeq 0.69 \\times 10^{-38} \\left(\\frac{E_\\nu}{ 1 \\rm{\\; GeV}}\\right) \\rm{ \\; cm}^2\\] \\[\\sigma_{\\bar{\\nu} p} \\simeq 0.35 \\times 10^{-38}\\left(\\frac{E_\\nu}{ 1 \\rm{\\; GeV}}\\right) \\rm{ \\; cm}^2\\]\nSometimes the cross-section is expressed as \\(\\nu + N\\) where \\(N\\) is the nucleon definition as:\n\\[N = \\frac{n+p}{2}\\]\nEarth is transparent to GeV neutrinos\nWe are going to calculate the mean free path of neutrinos of energies of \\(\\sim GeV\\). Note that mean free path can be expressed as:\n\\[l = \\frac{1}{n_N \\sigma_{\\nu N}}\\]\nwhere \\(n_N\\) is the number density of nucleons and not atoms. As we saw in lecture 2 we can re-express the number density as:\n\\[n_N = \\frac{N_A}{\\mathcal{M}}\\rho\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is the molar mass of one mole of nucleons and \\(\\rho\\) is the mass density of the medium. However, by definition a mol of nucleons has a mass of 1 g (Remember that a mol of \\(^{12}C\\) atoms has a mass of 12 g). So, we can rewrite as \\(n_N = N_A \\rho\\). Below there is another way to estimate the mean free path:\n\nfrom astropy import constants as ct\nfrom astropy import units as u\n#Earth mass\nprint (ct.M_earth)\n\n#Neutron/proton mass\nprint (ct.m_n)\n\n#Earth radius\nprint (ct.R_earth)\n\n#number of nucleons\nN = ct.M_earth/ct.m_n \n\n#Earth volume\nVe = 4/3*np.pi*ct.R_earth**3\n\n#Nucleon density\nNd = N/Ve\n\n#Cross section\ns = 1e-38 * u.cm**2\n#Mean free path:\nL = 1/(s * Nd.to(1/u.cm**3))\n\nprint (f\"The mean free path is: {L.to(u.km)}\")\n\n  Name   = Earth mass\n  Value  = 5.972167867791379e+24\n  Uncertainty  = 1.3422009501651213e+20\n  Unit  = kg\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 3 + CODATA 2018\n  Name   = Neutron mass\n  Value  = 1.67492749804e-27\n  Uncertainty  = 9.5e-37\n  Unit  = kg\n  Reference = CODATA 2018\n  Name   = Nominal Earth equatorial radius\n  Value  = 6378100.0\n  Uncertainty  = 0.0\n  Unit  = m\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 3\nThe mean free path is: 304808158.9154454 km\n\n\n\n\n3.3.6 Neutrino cross-sections at TeV energies\n\nAt low energies the valence quark parton distribution dominates and both the neutrino NC and CC cross-section grows linear with energy since the transfer momemtum \\(q^2 \\ll M_{W,Z}\\) and so the propagator term is \\(\\sim 1/M^2_{W,Z}\\)\nAbove 10\\(^{4}\\) GeV where the gauge-boson propagator restricts the momentum transfer to values near \\(M_{W,Z}\\) (\\(\\sim 1/(q^2 - M^2_{W,Z})\\)) and damps the cross-section increase.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.7 High energy Cross-Sections\nThe following shows the neutrino cross section:\n\n\n\nCalculated neutrino cross sections taken from arXiv:1309.1764\n\n\n\nAt high energies the asymetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos is lost due to the interaction with sea quarks (\\(q\\bar{q}\\))\nNeutrinos interact mostly with hadrons (quarks) instead of electrons due the their larger target mass. However at \\(E_\\nu \\approx 6.3\\) PeV the Glashow resonance appears: \\({\\hbar \\nu_e} + e \\rightarrow W\\) making the cross-section higher than the one with hadrons. ### Earth Opaque to PeV Neutrinos\nAt about 100 TeV the mean free path for neutrino-nucleus scattering is about 10\\(^{10}\\) c.m.w.e. which is about the matter thickness along the Earth diameter.\nThis means that UHE neutrino observatories (like IceCube) the flux of neutrinos comming from the nadir is stronly suppressed.\nThere is only one exception. A very high energy beam of \\(\\nu_\\tau\\) at one side of the Earth \\(E\\gg 1\\) PeV can end up at the other side as lower energy \\(\\nu_\\tau, \\nu_e,\\nu_\\mu\\) thought the tau regeneration effect: \\(\\nu_\\tau \\rightarrow \\tau \\rightarrow \\nu_\\tau\\)\n\n\n\n3.3.8 Neutrino signatures in a detector\n\n\n\nIn CC \\(\\nu_e\\) interactions an hadronic and EM shower initiated by the \\(e\\) is produced. About 20% of the energy goes in the hadronic shower and 80% to the lepton and therfore to the EM shower.\n\n\nIn CC \\(\\nu_\\tau\\) d) interaction again an hadronic and EM shower are produced as the \\(\\tau\\) decays almost inmediately to pions or other charge leptons. In the decay another \\(\\nu_\\tau\\) is produced tau regeneration effect. At very high energyes the two showers can be separated giving a double bang signature or a lollipop if the first shower happens outside the detector.\n\n\nIn CC \\(\\nu_\\mu\\) the muon only undergoes radiation losses (not ionization) and hence the track of the muon can be reconstructed.\n\n\nIn NC only an hadronic shower is visible.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.9 Event rate in an underground experiment.\nAn estimate of the detection rate of neutrino events is equivalent to calculate the rate of a neutrino-induced muon/cascades flux:\n\\[R(E_{vis}, \\theta) = \\int_{E_{vis}} P_{\\nu\\rightarrow l} (E_\\nu, E_{vis}) P_{shadow}(\\theta, E_\\nu) \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}N_\\nu}{\\mathrm{ d}E_\\nu}\\mathrm{ d}E_\\nu\\]\nwhere * \\(P_{\\nu\\rightarrow l}(E_\\nu, E_{vis})\\). Probability that a neutrino interacts with an nucleus to produce a \\(\\mu\\) or an EM or hadronic cascade with a minimum energy \\(E_{vis}\\) visible in the detector. * \\(P_{shadow} (\\theta, E_\\nu)\\). Probability of neutrino with zenith angle \\(\\theta\\) and energy \\(E_\\nu\\) of being absorved by Earth. * \\({\\mathrm{ d}N_\\nu}/{\\mathrm{ d}E_\\nu}\\). Neutrino flux at the surface.\n\n\n3.3.10 Interaction probability: \\(P_{\\nu\\rightarrow l}\\)\nThe probability of a neutrino to produce a lepton or shower visible in the detector can be writen as:\n\\[P_{\\nu \\rightarrow l} = N_A \\int_{E_{min}}^{E_\\nu} \\mathrm{ d}E_l \\frac{\\mathrm{ d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{ d}E_l}r_l(E_l, E_{vis})\\]\nwhere \\(r_l\\) is the detection range of the produced lepton/cascade with energy \\(E_l\\) ending with the minimal energy \\(E_{vis}\\), and \\({\\mathrm{ d}\\sigma}/{\\mathrm{ d}E_l}\\) is the neutrino cross-section to produce a lepton/cascade with energy \\(E_l\\).\nAt high energy the event rate is dominated by neutrino-induced muons due to the long range of the high energy muons.\n\n\n3.3.11 Earth Shadow: \\(P_{shadow}\\)\nThe mean free path of neutrinos can be expressed as \\(\\lambda = (N_A \\sigma_{tot})^{-1}\\). The shadow fact then can be expressed as:\n\\[P_{shadow} = e^{-N_A \\sigma_{tot} X(\\theta)}\\]\nWhere \\(X(\\theta)\\) is the column depth travelled by the neutrino through the Earth with a zenith angle \\(\\theta\\).\nSee Exercises 2 for an evaluation of the event rate in an underground detector.\n\n\n3.3.12 Neutrino Oscillations\nNeutrinos are generated in flavor eingenstate however propagation is done in mass eingenstate, since each planar wave has a different frecuency given their different masses, the neutrino detected (also in flavor eingenstate) will have a different interference pattern than the one generated given rise to neutrino flavor oscillations.\n\nAs a result of these changes in relative phases, neutrinos oscillate from one flavor to another as they travel. Low-energy neutrinos oscillate in a shorter distance than high-energy neutrinos.\nA curious aspect of quantum physics is that only the probability of the flavor of neutrino changes as it travels.\nThe neutrino only becomes a definite flavor when it interacts in a detector - by finding whether an electron, muon, tau is created.\n\n\n\n3.3.13 The PMNS Matrix\nThe Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix is the one that relates the mass eingenstates with the flavor eingenstates:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu \\\\ \\nu_\\tau \\end{pmatrix} = U_{PMNS} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\\\ \\nu_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nwith:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_{PMNS} &=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{12}c_{13} & s_{12}c_{13} & s_{13}e^{-i\\delta} \\\\\n-s_{12}c_{23} - c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & c_{12}c_{23} - s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & s_{23}c_{13} \\\\\ns_{12}s_{23} - c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & -c_{12}s_{23} - s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & c_{23}c_{13} \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\\\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\\delta} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -s_{13}e^{i\\delta} & 0 & c_{13}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\\\ -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_{ij} = \\sin \\theta_{ij}\\), \\(c_{ij} = \\cos \\theta_{ij}\\). The term \\(\\delta\\) is a CP violation term, if \\(s_{13} = 0\\) we won’t be able to measure \\(\\delta\\) as it always multiplies \\(s_{13}\\)\n\n\n3.3.14 The 2-flavor mixing case\nLet’s assume 2 flavor eigenstates identified as rotations of 2 mass eigenstates:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) is called the mixing angle.\nThe mass eigenstates evolve as plane waves with fixed momemtum \\(p\\):\n\\[|\\nu_{i}(t, x)\\rangle = e^{ -i (E_{i} t - p_i x) }|\\nu_{i}(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nLet’s imagine we start at \\((x,t) = (0,0)\\) with a pure beam of \\(\\nu_e\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\nu_1(0,0) \\\\ \\nu_2(0,0) \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\\[|\\nu_{1}(0,0)\\rangle = \\cos \\theta\\] \\[|\\nu_{2}(0,0)\\rangle = \\sin \\theta\\]\nand as they evolved:\n\\[|\\nu_{1}(t,x)\\rangle = \\cos \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  }\\] \\[|\\nu_{2}(t,x)\\rangle = \\sin \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) }\\]\nSo after a while the wave form of the \\(\\nu_\\alpha\\) is given by:\n\\[|\\nu_{e}(t, x)\\rangle = \\cos^2 \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  } + \\sin^2 \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) } = A_e\\] \\[|\\nu_{\\mu}(t, x)\\rangle = -sin\\theta\\cos \\theta e^{ -i (E_{1} t - p_1 x)  } + \\cos\\theta\\sin \\theta e^{ -i (E_{2} t - p_2 x) } = A_e\\]\n\n3.3.14.1 Example of survival probability for the 2-flavor mixing\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu) = \\left|\\langle \\nu_{\\mu}(t,x)|\\nu_{e}(0,0)\\rangle\\right|^2 &=\\left|\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta (e^{i(E_2 t - p_2 x)} - e^{i(E_1 t -p_1 x)})\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\n\\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta \\left|e^{i(E_2 t - p_2 x)} - e^{i(E_1 t -p_1 x)}\\right|^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nusing \\(e^{\\pm ix} = \\cos x \\pm i\\sin x\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu)&= 2 \\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ( 1 - \\cos (E_2t - p_2x - E_1 t - p_1 x))\\\\\n&= \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{(E_2 - E_1)t - (p_2 - p_1)x }{2}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2 L}{4E}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nusing \\(p_i = \\sqrt{E^2_i -m_i^2}\\sim E_i(1-\\frac{m^2_i}{E_i^2})\\), and in natural units \\(t = x = L\\) we can write the phase difference as:\n\\[(E_2 - E_1)t - (p_2 - p_1)x = (\\frac{m_1^2}{2E_1}-\\frac{m_2^2}{2E_2})L = \\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2L}{2E}\\]\nAnd the survival probability is:\n\\[P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e)  = 1 - P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu) = 1- \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta m_{12}^2 L}{4E}\\right)\\]\nReplacing \\(\\hbar\\) and \\(c\\) the expression can be written as:\n\\[P(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e)  = 1 - \\sin^2 2\\theta \\sin^2\\left[1.27 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta m^2_{12}}\\mathrm{{ eV}^2}\\right)\\frac{L/\\rm{ km}}{E/\\rm{ GeV}}\\right]\\]\nWe assumed that the mass eigenstates are created with the same energy or momentum and so \\(E_i = E_j\\).This assumption is not necessary and it comes from the fact we use the plane wave approximation. Using the correct formalism of wave packets the result is the same.\n\n\n\n3.3.15 Tutorial III: Plot the survival probability of \\(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e\\)\n\nimport astropy.units as u\n\nL = 180 # km\n\ndelta_m_sun = 7.0e-5 # eV^2\nsin_square_theta_12 = 0.84 #maximum mixing\n\n\ndef prob_survival(E, L):\n    return 1 - sin_square_theta_12 * np.sin(1.27*delta_m_sun * L / E)**2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,4))\nax.set_ylim(0,1)\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\nu (\\mathrm{ MeV})$\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"$P_{ee}$\")\n\nE = np.linspace(0.1, 15, 1000) #in MeV\n\nax.plot(E, prob_survival(E*1e-3,L), lw=2, \n        label=\"L = %i km\\n\"%L+r\"$P_{ee} = 1 -\\sin^2 2\\theta\\sin^2(\\Delta m^2L/4E_\\nu)$\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"best\")\nax.grid()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually at low enough E / long baselines, neutrino beam becomes fully mixed and energy resolution and source extent conspire to produce 50/50 beam.\n\ny, x = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(50,180,100), np.linspace(0.1, 15, 100) )\nz = prob_survival(x*1e-3,y)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\nimg = ax.pcolormesh(x, y, z, cmap = 'RdBu', shading='auto')\n\ncax = fig.colorbar(img)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Distance (km)\")\nax.set_xlabel(r\"$E_\\nu (\\mathrm{ MeV})$\")\ncax.set_label(\"Probability\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.16 General case\nTaking greek letters of the flavor eingenstates and latin letter the mass eingenstates we can write:\n\\[|\\nu_\\alpha(x,t)\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} |\\nu_k (x,t)\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} e^{-i\\Phi_k}|\\nu_k (0,0)\\rangle\\]\ninverting the mixing matrix we have:\n\\[|\\nu_k (0,0)\\rangle =\\sum_\\gamma U^*_{\\gamma  k} |\\nu_\\gamma(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nputting it in the equation above:\n\\[|\\nu_\\alpha(x,t)\\rangle =\\sum_{k=1,2,3} U_{\\alpha k} e^{-i\\Phi_k}\\sum_\\gamma U^*_{\\gamma  k} |\\nu_\\gamma(0,0)\\rangle\\]\nIf we want to evaluate the probability of finding a neutrino \\(\\beta\\) when we had \\(\\alpha\\) is the transition amplitude is given by:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{A}(\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta(x,t)) &= \\langle \\nu_\\beta(x,t)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle \\\\\n&= \\sum_\\gamma \\sum_k U_{\\gamma k}e^{i\\Phi_k}U^*_{\\beta k}\\langle \\nu_\\gamma(0,0)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle \\\\\n&= \\sum_k U_{\\alpha  k}e^{i\\Phi_k}U^*_{\\beta k}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere we used the fact that flavor eingenstates are ortogonal and hence \\(\\langle \\nu_\\gamma(0,0)|\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rangle = \\delta_{\\gamma,\\alpha}\\).\nThe oscillation probability is then:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = |\\mathcal{A}(\\nu_\\alpha(0,0)\\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta(x,t))|^2 &= \\left|\\sum_k U_{\\alpha i}e^{i\\Phi_i}U^*_{\\beta i}\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\\sum_i U_{\\alpha i}e^{i\\Phi_i}U^*_{\\beta i}\\sum_j U^*_{\\alpha j}e^{-i\\Phi_j}U_{\\beta j}\\\\\n&=\\sum_j\\sum_i U_{\\alpha i}U^*_{\\beta i}U^*_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}e^{-i(\\Phi_j-\\Phi_i)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi_i = E_i t- p_i x\\) and so:\n\\[\\Phi_i - \\Phi_j = (E_i - E_j)t - (p_i -p_j)x\\]\nusing \\(p_i = \\sqrt{E^2_i -m_i^2}\\sim E_i(1-\\frac{m^2_i}{E_i^2})\\) we can write the phase difference as:\n\\[\\Phi_i - \\Phi_j = (\\frac{m_i^2}{2E_i}-\\frac{m_j^2}{2E_j})L = \\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^2L}{2E}\\]\nwhere we used the fact that at relativistic speeds \\(t = x = L\\) and a dodgy approximation where we assumed that the mass eigenstates are created with the same energy or momentum and so \\(E_i = E_j\\).This assumption is not necessary, but we find that whatever assumption is made you get the the same result. The fact that we have to make such an approximation comes from the way that we are modelling the mass eigenstates as plane waves. If we were to do the analysis assuming that the mass states were wavepackets instead we would not need the equal momentum (equal energy) assumption and would still get the same answer.\nWith this we can rewrite the oscillation probability as:\n\\[\\begin{matrix}P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta)=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} & - & 4{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Re}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*}})\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{4E})\\\\ & + & {\\displaystyle 2\\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Im}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*})\\sin(}\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{2E}),\\end{matrix}\\]\nFor \\(\\delta = 0\\) the last term is 0.\n\n\n3.3.17 About symmetries.\n\nConsequences of CPT invariance:\n\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\alpha})\\]\n\nConditions of CP invariance:\n\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) \\]\n\nCondition os T invariance:\n\n\\[P({\\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\nu_\\beta}) = P({\\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\nu_\\alpha})\\mathrm{\\; and\\; }P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) = P({\\bar \\nu_\\beta} \\rightarrow {\\bar\\nu_\\alpha})\\]\nOnly if \\(U\\) is not real we can have CP violation effects ie:\n\\[P(\\nu_\\alpha \\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta) - P({\\bar \\nu_\\alpha} \\rightarrow {\\bar \\nu_\\beta}) ={ 4 \\sum_{i&gt;j}\\mathrm{ Im}(U_{\\alpha i}^{*}U_{\\beta i}U_{\\alpha j}U_{\\beta j}^{*})\\sin(}\\frac{\\Delta m_{ij}^{2}L}{2E})\\]\n\n\n3.3.18 Mass hierarchy\nBut this means that neutrinos oscillations can be described in terms of 6 parameters: \\(\\theta_{12}\\), \\(\\theta_{13}\\) and \\(\\theta_{23}\\) plus 2 mass-squared differences, \\(\\Delta m_{12}^2\\) and \\(\\Delta m_{32}^2\\) and one CP violating phase \\(\\delta_{CP}\\).

The combined effect is:\n\\[4p \\rightarrow ^4He + 2e^+ 2\\nu_e\\]\nFrom the beginning of the solar-neutrino observation a deficit of the electron neutrino predicted by the Standard Solar Model was observed: the solar-neutrino problem\nIn 1999 SNO in Canada started taking data. This experiment was able to detect \\(\\nu_e\\) by CC interactions and \\(\\nu_x\\) by NC interaction solving the mistery of the solar-neutrino problem. It is now understood as a neutrino flavor oscillation. The results of SNO together with KamLAND (a long baseline neutrino detector) confirmed the Large Mixing Angle solution (LMA) of the solar sector:\n\\[\\sin^2 \\theta_{12} \\simeq 0.30\\] \\[\\Delta m_{12}^2 \\equiv \\Delta m_{\\odot}^2 \\simeq 8 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{ \\; eV^2}\\]\n\n\n3.3.20 Atmospheric Neutrinos\nFirst evidence of atmospheric neutrino oscillations came from Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. By scanning in zenith angle, is like changing the \\(L\\).\n\nIf atmospheric mixing is non-maximal, it remains to determine in which “octant” the mixing angle \\(\\theta_{23}\\) lies. For a \\(\\theta_{23}\\) in the first octant (\\(&lt; 45^{\\circ}\\)) the mass eigenstate \\(\\nu_3\\) is tau heavy, i.e., the tau neutrino fraction is larger than the muon neutrino fraction. Conversely, for a \\(\\theta_{23}\\) in the second octant (\\(&gt; 45^{\\circ}\\)) the state \\(\\nu_3\\) is muon heavy.\n\n\n3.3.21 Reactor Neutrinos\n\nDouble Chooz: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.109 \\pm 0.030 \\pm 0.025 \\neq 0\\) at \\(2.9\\sigma\\)\nDaya Bay: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.089 \\pm 0.010 \\pm 0.005 \\neq 0\\) at \\(7.7\\sigma\\)\nRENO: \\(\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} = 0.113 \\pm 0.013 \\pm 0.019 \\neq 0\\) at \\(4.9\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\n3.3.22 Neutrino oscillations in matter.\nThe \\(U_{PMNS}\\) matrix must be modified to account for the the fact that electron neutrinos have an extra interaction not present for \\(\\nu_\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu_\\tau\\) when travelling through matter. Elastic scattering of \\(\\nu_e\\) on electron can occur via exchange of a charged \\(W\\)-boson as well as by exchange of the neutral \\(Z\\)-boson adding a term \\(V_e = G_F \\sqrt{2}N_e\\) in the mass differences for electrons.\nWithout entering in the maths, what happens here is that a resonance effect occurs, ie, even if the mixing angle is small in vacuum it can get amplified in matter. This resonance can be expressed as a condition on the electron density \\(N_e\\) which is appropriate for systems such as stellar interiors (Sun or supernovae too) where provided the core density is high enough, there is always a region in the neutrinos’ path exiting the star where it passes through resonance.\nThis is known as the MSW effect for the theorists who discovered it - Mikheyev, Smirnov, and Wolfenstein.\n\n\n3.3.23 Tutorial III: Calculate the probabilities of \\(\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_x\\) as function of L/E\n\ndef PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, d):\n    s12 = np.sin(t12)\n    c12 = np.cos(t12)\n    s23 = np.sin(t23)\n    c23 = np.cos(t23)\n    s13 = np.sin(t13)\n    c13 = np.cos(t13)\n    cp  = np.exp(1j*d)\n    return np.array([[ c12*c13, s12*c13, s13*np.conj(cp) ],\n                  [-s12*c23 - c12*s23*s13*cp, c12*c23 - s12*s23*s13*cp, s23*c13],\n                  [ s12*s23 - c12*s23*s13*cp,-c12*s23 - s12*c23*s13*cp, c23*c13]])\ndef posc(a, b, U, dm2, LEratio):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gives the oscillation probability for nu(a) -&gt; nu(b)\n    for PMNS matrix U, and L in km and E in GeV, and dm2 in eV^2\n    \"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    for j in range(2):\n        for i in range(j+1, 3):\n            arg = 5.068*dm2[i+j-1]*LEratio\n            mxe = np.conj(U[a,i])*U[b,i]*U[a,j]*np.conj(U[b,j])\n            s += -4*mxe.real*np.sin(0.25*arg)**2 + 2*mxe.imag*np.sin(0.50*arg)\n    if a == b: s += 1.0\n    return s\nt12 = np.arcsin(0.312**0.5)\nt13 = np.arcsin(0.0251**0.5) #Controlls the size of the small wiggles.\n#t13 = np.arcsin(0.0)\nt23 = np.arcsin(0.42**0.5)\n\ndm2 = [ 7.58E-05, 2.27E-03, 2.35E-03]\ndelta = 0\n\nU = PMNS_Factory(t12, t13, t23, delta)\n\n\nLE = np.linspace(0, 36000, 3600)\nPe = posc(0, 0, U, dm2, LE)\nPm = posc(0, 1, U, dm2, LE)\nPt = posc(0, 2, U, dm2, LE)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4))\nax.plot(LE, Pe, '-', label=r'$\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_e$')\nax.plot(LE, Pm, 'k', label=r'$\\nu_e\\rightarrow\\nu_\\mu$')\nax.plot(LE, Pt, 'r', label=r'$\\nu_e\\rightarrow\\nu_\\tau$')\nax.set_xlabel(\"L/E (km/GeV)\")\nax.set_ylabel(r\"Probability $\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_x$\")\nax.set_ylim(0,1)\nax.grid()\nplt.legend(loc=\"best\")\nplt.show()",
